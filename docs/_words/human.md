I wish I wasn't human, with human flaws
I wish I could think without being overwhelmed by it all

I wish I could cross the road without being distracted by
the sound of a horn, or a flash of light in my eye

I wish I didn't have to spend so much of my days
maintaining, so at its end I might have a moment to play

I wish I had control over the things I do
I wish I could manage my reactions to others too

I wish I acted the same from this day to that
I wish the weight of my life wasn't all on my back

I wish that my body wasn't so fragile and limp
I wish my mind under strain wouldn't start to skip

I know all these things must come with this life
no matter whether I believe it's wrong or it's right

I wish I could tell you what I want, above all
without feeling ashamed, or failed, or small

I know you may think that all this wishing of mine
is a flaw in itself, a problem self-defined

But I will tell you anyhow what I planned to say
if you promise you won't repeat it along with my name

Because what I've always wanted most of all
since before I ever knew how far I could fall

is to be a computer
but don't we all?
