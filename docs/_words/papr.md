We missed the feeling of paper
but there were no more trees.
Just nickel, and cobalt
and manganese.

Bookshelves lined with
plugs and hidden wires.
Words on Permanent Pixel Papr™
bound in recycled tires.

With Papr pinched between our fingers
we sit and think in dreams:
of how the fibers felt to hold
made warm in the windows beam.

Of forest filled with trees that
had the chance to grow old.
Of the shade and air and furrowed bark
that wrapped their tender souls.

Then our minds return, and we
swipe our fingers across the screen.
And watch as the page before
— too quickly — fades into history.
