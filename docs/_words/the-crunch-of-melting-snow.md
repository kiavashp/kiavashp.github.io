The snow on the ground dampened the air to a near silence. It was the kind of stillness that only becomes more apparent against the crunches of snow melting beneath booted feet.
	The town was often quiet, and especially so in times like this. Soon traffic would resume, pushing tracks through the frozen ground, bringing the hungry home for dinner. But for now, on this winter's day, the world outside nestled into a deep lull. And inside an unassuming shop on a quiet street, an ancient battle was being fought.

"Ah shit. How did I not see that coming?" Says Darwin, finally realizing Karl's Knight is threatening both members of his royal couple.
	There's only one move he can make. He begrudgingly slides the Kings felt foot to the corner square, cowering behind the feeble pawns, and leaving his Queen out for the taking. Six moves later and Karl's Queen and Rook join the party, locking His Majesty where he stands.
	"Ha! Checkmate! Suck it!" Karl hollers as he throws himself back in the squeaky plastic chair and slaps the table.
	"Damn. Good game." Darwin says and looks through the plexiglass to the empty shop. "Are you sure there's nothing more... productive that we could be doing?"
	Karl starts resetting the board. "Like what? Can't restock the shelves if they're still full."
	"I don't know, go put up flyers or something? It feels like all we've really done is sit here and waste time."
	"In this weather?" Karl scoffs.
	It's not as bad as it looks. I've cowboy camped in worse. Darwin thinks to himself.
	Karl continues shuffling the pieces back to their starting positions. "Look man, this business is struggling for a reason, and it's not because my folks are slackers." He explains. "Like I tried to tell 'em a million times, digital marketplaces are the future! Everyone knows that, and there's no stopping it. Even the old, frail, sacks of skin in this place are on board now."
	Darwin rolls his eyes in frustration. There's always something you can do. He wants to tell him.
	A bell rings violently and a crisp breeze whistles through the stale room.
	"Ah shit. Except this fucker." Karl looks down at his watch and mumbles to himself. "Seriously old man?"
	"I got it." Darwin says.
	A rugged old man, with a green beret, comes through the spring-loaded front doors, and begins walking along the wall. Darwin's seat screeches against the linoleum floor as he stands suddenly, pushing it back with his calves. The man whips his head towards them, but not out of fear. After confirming the source of the sound, he grabs a cable from the wall, turns it around to read the label, and sets it on the shelf above the rack where it hung.
	"Na man, let him wander. Let's get one more game in and get the fuck out of here." Karl continues.
	"We can't just not help him." Darwin says.
	The man grabs another item off the wall.
	"Dude, why the fuck do you always care so much? Aren't you just here for the money, so you can go camping all summer or something?" Karl looks out at the old man. A satchel hangs over his broad shoulders and sits at an angle against his heavy waist. "That guy's fucking crazy anyway. He'll never find what he's looking for."
	"What do you mean?"
	"I mean, he doesn't have a fucking clue how technology works. He thinks it's magic or some shit, and that we can make it do anything he wants. I'm not going to stop you, but trust me, it's not even worth trying."
	Darwin—now standing at the door—begrudgingly waits for him to finish, then pushes his way to the front room.
	"Don't say I didn't warn you!" Karl yells as the door bounces back and forth before resting in place.
	The upper shelves are coated in dust. Three lights in the ceiling burn a fluorescent blue, two are dark, and the last flickers in sporadic rhythms over the old man's head. Cold blue eyes pierce through the shaggy off-white hair that's drawn across his face and dangles from his rounded chin. The man clears his throat behind a fist, then erupts in a cough, after having moved it away.
	"Welcome to Carlson Cameras." Darwin says on approach. "Can I help you find anything today?"
	The man grunts and continues searching the wall of equipment in a near limp, his spine bent slightly to the right, away from the satchel bouncing just below his waist. Sticking out of the side pocket is a roll of film, wound loosely and heavily creased.
	"Right over here, Sir," Darwin started, rushing ahead of the man to the back corner of the room, "are the film cameras and other vintage items—all used but fully functional—if that's what you're looking for." He looked up at the shelves. "We have everything from the Nikon F series, to the Zunow SLR, which was originally sold exclusively in Japan—or so I've been told."
	The man looks past Darwin, to the cameras on the wall. Some sit assembled in display cases, and others, still pristine in their original packaging. He rests a hand on his satchel, and takes a long breath. "What was ever wrong with all these, huh?" The man finally says. "When did cameras get so damn complicated?"
	"We also have some simpler modern cameras I can show you if you'd like! What are you looking to use your camera for, primarily?" Darwin responds eagerly.
	"No. Thanks. Already got one."
	"Oh, well, then what, if anything, can I help you with today?"
	"I already been through this with the other guy, and he was no help." The man said, glancing through the window to the back room. "Customer service just ain't what it used to be I guess."
	"I'm sorry about that. Maybe I can help. What is it you need?" Darwin repeated.
	"Like I told your friend back there, my camera works just fine. Never gave me no problems, and I could fix it on my own too, if it ever did. Just needs some protection from the weather, is all. And to take a picture when it sees something move—like them fancy new cameras do."
	"Oh neat! Well I'm sure we can figure something out. Are you a nature photographer?"
	"Sure, something like that." He responds abruptly, as if to force the conversation along.
	Darwin scans the wall, still unfamiliar with most of the equipment, looking for something that might suit his needs. His eyes search the wall a few times before he turns to search another. The man starts fiddling with the top flap of his bag, snapping the button on and off.
	"So, can you help me or not?" He says, knocking Darwin out of his daze.
	"Yes. Of course. My apologies." Darwin hesitates. "Do you mind if I take a look? Is that your camera in there?" Darwin says, looking at the man's satchel.
	"Yeah." He mumbles, and lifts the flap.
	Inside is a camera as old as any Darwin has ever seen. The black textured body is worn around the sides, leaving channels of black lines spidering between the exposed metal. The top is lined with bulky knobs, more suited for heavy machinery than a camera, he thinks. A name that Darwin has never heard of is etched across its face, above the stubby lens. The font was something he felt like he'd seen in old black and white movies, maybe in the credits, or marquees; in all caps, squished together, with stunted limbs and wide sweeping curves. "Do you happen to know the model number?"
	"Why d'ya need to know that?"
	"Honestly I am not sure Sir. I've only worked here a couple weeks now. I am just trying to get as much information as I can."
	"Well, I don't know what to tell ya kid. I thought you's supposed to be the experts."
	Darwin grabs a tuft of his beard. "Is there anything else you can tell us about it? When you purchased it or where you got it from?"
	"I got it just before I shipped out, March of '61. My buddy sold cameras back then—lucky son of a bitch avoided the draft too. Told me it was the nicest damn rig money could buy. Shipped all the way from those Italians, if you can believe it. Got one of them eye-level finders and everything. So don't go telling me it's not good for nothing."
	"Oh-Okay great. I'll see what I can do. I'll be right back."
	Darwin opens the door to Karls expectant look. "What did I say? Fucking crazy, right?"
	"What are you doing? Playing with yourself now?" Darwin says, looking down at the battlefield between them.
	"Yeah, you're not doing too hot. You really need to get better at protecting your Queen."
	Darwin rolls his eyes, and continues. "So do you have any idea how to help this guy?"
	"Yeah, I can find him the address of a psych ward. I'm not the one driving him there though."
	"Dude. I'm serious." Darwin insisted on sternly. "I was thinking for weather proofing, we could just get him—"
	"No dude. I'm serious. Fuck that guy."
	"Why are you—"
	"Sit down." Karl demands, nodding towards the empty chair.
	"I'm not playing another game dude."
	"I'm not trying to—Just fucking listen for a second, okay?" Karl pauses to take a breath and shake off some of the built up anger. "That clunky piece of crap he has was one of the first SLR cameras, ever. Made back in the late 1940's by a company called Reflex or some shit."
	"I think it was Rectaflex. I saw the—"
	"Yeah, whatever man." Karl interrupts. "So anyway, he brings it in to get it repaired—which like, cool, fair enough, I guess my parents signed up for this shit. But dude, we start working on a quote for him and we can't find jack shit on this thing. No spec sheets, no spare parts, no specialty repair shops. We can't even find anyone who's ever seen one in real life. That is, until we find this old dinky ass website, made by some retired camera nerd with nothing better to do with their life. Says he used to be an engineer at Reflex. But our little friend over there didn't want his camera sent to Italy. So my dad offers to fabricate the replacement parts himself—which as you might imagine, is expensive as hell. But no, turns out this old fucker's a cheapskate too. So he takes it back home, says he'll fix it himself, and brings it back even more busted than it was in the first place! He shattered the mirror while trying to take it apart, and the inside looked like it went through a fucking sandstorm."
	"Damn. But dude, I'm really just trying to help—"
	"God damn! Just hold on a minute man. You're going to want to hear this."
	Darwin sighs and slumps into his seat, then looks back at the man in the beret.
	Karl doesn't wait for him to turn around before starting again. "My dad argued with this guy about pricing for hours before he finally agreed to the repairs. Dude could have bought at least three Gopro's with what he paid to fix that pile of crap, and still, my dad was losing money on the deal. And after we spent all that time fixing it, he came in asking why it randomly stops working in the snow! Then, out of fucking nowhere, he starts talking about some magic portal he found in the forest. Said a bunch of hikers were stuck on the other side or something crazy like that. I'm telling you, that guy has seriously lost it. He wanted to take pictures of this portal thing when he wasn't around, in case it—get this—'opens up again, or the boys find a way to escape.' Like what the fuck is this guy on? And where can I get some?
	"We were the ones who told him he needs a camera that's weather-proofed and motion triggered, but he refused to upgrade. He just kept coming back day after day, demanding there must be a way to use his old ass piece of shit, claiming "they could do it just fine back in the Vietnam War." Last time he came in, he had a full on hissy fit, yelling about how we were useless hacks and that he was never coming back."
	"Damn."
	"Yeah. That's what I'm fucking saying. And you thought I was being dramatic."
	"No, I didn't. I just—"
	"Dude, you don't need to defend yourself. I really don't care." Karl looks out at the old man. "I'm going to tell him the store is closed, and then we can finally leave." He walks towards the door.
	Darwin blurts out, "NO!"
	Karl stops and looks back, his face sunken and eyes tense. Darwin is surprised too. They look at each other for a moment, as if they're arguing in their silence.
	"Fine. Then I'm going home." Karl says as he steps back and heads for the back exit. "Good luck!" He says sarcastically, then under his breath, "Weirdo."
	Darwin scoots the chair in as forcefully as he can, in a flimsy attempt to mask the sound of the back door slamming shut. He tries to collect himself while putting away the chess board, and wiping the salty crumbs and dried salsa from the table.
	The old man is still standing in front of the vintage section when Darwin returns, randomly going through the boxes on the shelves, reading them one by one. His eyes shift at Darwin's presence, but he doesn't turn around.
	"So, can you help me or not?" He asks, grabbing another box from the shelf.
	Darwin thought back to the Arizona Trail he did the previous summer. To a twenty mile stretch with no water, and one of the steeper climbs. A freak accident, he misread the map. He wasn't prepared. There were times during that stretch that he dreamed of lapping water out of the sky, and almost did, before realizing he'd probably lose just as much to evaporation. This is normal. I'll survive. Others have done this without water before. He lied to himself and trusted it would somehow work out in the end. Like jumping off a cliff and hoping something will catch you before you hit the ground. It was the only way to keep himself from spiraling or giving up completely.
	"I think so." Darwin says, and pauses like he's waiting to see if that was enough. "We're—My coworker—is working out the details now. It's—it's not every day we get a request like this."
	The burly man huffs in irritated acceptance.
	"So, Karl back there was telling me about that spot you found in the forest?" Darwin asks, and waits for a response.
	The man readjusts the satchel on his shoulder.
	"There was this one place I was hiking through once," Darwin continues, "that was truly magical, on an overnighter I did in the Olympics. It was the most beautiful section of forest I'd ever seen. The mossy arms of those big leaf maples arched across the trail like they were woven into an upside-down basket that went on for miles."
	The man's face lifts slightly, offering Darwin more of his attention.
	"It was after that day," Darwin goes on, "that I told myself, I'd always have a camera on me when I went into the mountains."
	The man took a brief moment, then tripped over his words before he could get them out.
	"Yeah well, this place is more stunning than anything you ever saw. The water drops were just floating there, the first time I seen it. The sun was making the drops look like fairies or something. Like it was alive. The forest knew I was there. I felt it. And in the ground I seen this big old gash in the floor. Like a tree fell and tore the dirt up with it. That's where I found the radio signals coming from. That's where the boys fell in, to the other side."
	Darwin searches for something to respond to. "That sounds pretty cool." He says hesitantly. "Do you have any pictures?"
	"No, but I has a blog all about it. Trying to get the word out so we can get those boys home, from wherever they is."
	Darwin turns away for a moment to compose himself.
	The man continues. "What's your name, son?"
	"Darwin. And I'm sorry, I didn't get yours."
	"Aaron." The man says quickly. "You know, Darwin. You remind me of Nate. He's always talking about things he seen in the forest. Good kid."
	"Oh yeah? Is Nate your son? Or grandson?"
	Aaron scoffs. "No. He and Jordan fell through that there rift I just told you about. They's the ones stuck in that other world, remember?"
	"Right, of course. I apologize." Darwin assures him, then pauses for a moment, at a loss for words. "Well, I'm curious to read that blog if you have the link." He says. "And to see pictures of this place, when you have them."
	Aaron takes a flip phone from his pocket, and fumbles it open with his meaty fingers. He mutters to himself as he rocks the arrow pad in every direction. His eyes dart back and forth across the little screen.
	Darwin watches with fragile patience, afraid to rush him, or offer help.
	Aaron grunts. "This damn thing never does what I want."
	"No worries. Take—"
	"There! Stupid thing." Aaron interrupts, swinging out the tiny screen, where a web browser is loading.
	Darwin pulls out his phone and starts typing the url.
	T-H-R-O-U-G-H-T-H-E.
	Darwin stops typing. "Sorry, I can't see the whole—"
	"Oh, here." Aaron turns the phone back and starts reading. "W-W-W, dot, through—er. How do I get this damn thing to show me the rest?"
	Darwin eventually gets the url, after more fumbling, and waiting, and finally offering to help.
	An uneasy silence falls upon them. Darwin starts reading the first post on the blog, from a few weeks ago. Aaron returns to pressing at his phone in frustration, then shoves it back in his pocket and wanders along the walls again.
	The wind outside picks up for a few gusts, then settles the world back into silence.
	Aaron catches the last rays of sunlight as they climb the store's front window, having made their way just over the melting snow on the opposite roof, and basks his face in warmth.
	"So, that camera you take to the mountains..." Aaron mumbles.
	The subtlest of smiles works its way across Darwin's face.
	"...Is it any good?"
