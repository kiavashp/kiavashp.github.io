A plane flies through the alley
it's engines sputter
— or at least that's what I hear

Furniture moves beneath the floorboards
A thump, something scrapes the paper walls

Wood fibers fray at the hands of bandits;
they'll make it through any day now

I feel their clawing through my feet
another sound to fill my cornered world

The refrigerator hums to stay alive
and turns to ringing in my ears

Then it clears its throat and
louder does the humming feel

It cycles into silence and
I hear a distant bird

like an afterthought, a memory
of the place this was before

Before the concrete flowed
into towers, across planes

Before this land was stripped of green
in pursuit of permanence, consistency

But it wasn't for not
— this covering of the earth
for now I have this box

Where the sun is three squares
in a white and rigid sky

and traces of green sit
in planters and frames

I've woken to the sound of
saws through rotted trunk

They're fighting their way in
like they can't get enough

The floor is shaking
so loud that I forget

There's a door, I can leave
It's not all covered yet

But there's a part of us we left
under this rubble-to-be

This was once our world too
something we pretend to still believe

I step outside, the sky it whistles;
their scratching can barely be heard

I stop to listen, take another step
breathe softly, and hang on every word

The deck boards creak and the clawing stops
my thoughts, they start to slow

I breathe the midnight air once more
then return to sleep, now undisturbed

Fucking raccoons.
