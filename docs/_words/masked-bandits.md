A plane flies through the alley
with engines sputtering
—or at least that's what I hear

Furniture moves beneath the floorboards
a thump, something scrapes the paper walls

wood fibers fray at the hand of bandits
—they'll make it through any week now

I hear it all through my feet
the sounds that fill my corner of the world

The refrigerator hums to stay alive
ringing in my ear
and then it clears its throat
and louder does the humming feel

When it cycles into silence
I can just make out the distant birds
like an afterthought, a memory
of the place this used to be

Before the concrete flowed
Before this land was made featureless

Mountains displaced by
towers of purified stone
Cycles now threatened by
the pursuit of permanence

But it wasn't for not, this covering of the earth
for now I have this box
which keeps the world outside its walls
and the musky air in

Where the sun is three rectangles
in a white and rigid sky
and the green that I seek
comes in planters and frames

I don't want to be here, so why do they?
my new neighbors
—the masked bandits
who play beneath the floor

Living amongst the foundation
trying to raise a family
fighting for a way into the world
we've covered theirs with

A world we've created without them
or without ourselves
