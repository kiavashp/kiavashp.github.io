summary: "\"Furniture moves beneath the floorboards<br>A thump, something scrapes the paper walls...\""
---

A plane flies through the alley
it's engines sputter
— or at least that's what I hear

Furniture moves beneath the floorboards
A thump, something scrapes the paper walls

Wood fibers fray at the hands of bandits;
they'll make it through any day now

I feel their clawing through my feet
another sound to fill my cornered world

The refrigerator hums to stay alive
and turns to ringing in my ears

Then it clears its throat and
louder does the humming feel

It cycles into silence and
I hear a distant bird

like an afterthought, a memory
of the place this was before

Before the concrete flowed
into towers, across planes

Before this land was stripped of green
in pursuit of permanence, consistency

But it wasn't for not
— this covering of the earth
for now I have this box

Where the sun is three squares
in a white and rigid sky

and the green that's left
sits in planters and frames

I've woken to the sound of
saws through rotted trunk

They're fighting their way in
and I struggle to get up

The floor is shaking so loud
that I almost forget

There's a door, I can leave
It's not all covered yet

But there's a part of us we left
under this rubble-to-be

This was once our world too
something we pretend to still believe

Outside the sky whistles
My lips quiver in the cold

I listen, but their scratching
can now barely be heard

I step closer, the deck creaks
and their clawing suddenly stops

I breath deep and finally
I'm able to slow my thoughts

The quiet of night gently returns and
I go back to sleep, now undisturbed

Fucking raccoons.
