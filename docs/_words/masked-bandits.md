---

A plane flies through the alley
with engines sputtering—
or at least that's what I hear

Furniture moves beneath the floorboards
A thump—something scrapes the paper walls

Wood fibers fray at the hand of bandits—
they'll make it through any week now

I hear them through my feet
sounds that fill my corner of the world

The refrigerator hums to stay alive
and turns to ringing in my ear
then it clears its throat
and louder does the humming feel

When it cycles into silence
I can just make out the distant birds
like an afterthought, a memory
of the place this was before

Before the concrete flowed
and grew into towers of stone
Before this land was rid of green
in the pursuit of permanence

But it wasn't for not, this covering of the earth
for now I have this box
which keeps the world outside its walls
and the musky air in

Where the sun is three rectangles
in a white and rigid sky
and the green I thought was lost
is in planters and frames

I don't want to be here
so why do they?
the masked bandits
who play beneath the floor

Trying to raise a family
amongst the foundation
Fighting for a way in
to our covered world

A world we've created without them
and perhaps, a part of ourselves
