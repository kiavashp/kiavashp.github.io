With the first piece made
I try forming the puzzle whole
in my mind, each contour
defined by the piece before

But soon I find
the picture’s not right
the first piece wasn’t perfect
nor was my foresight

So I tear them apart
while attempting to save
all the wasted effort
I made that day

All because of a belief
I hold to be true
that each piece must fit
the first time through
