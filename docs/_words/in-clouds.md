When he asked me about the craziest flight I’d ever been on, I assured him he wouldn’t believe me.

He proceeded to tell me about a particularly rough trip he had flying into Chicago. They got rerouted to Detroit, refueled, waited a few hours, then flew back to Chicago only to be told they couldn’t land. Forced to circle for another hour while they waited out the storm. A three hour flight from Salt Lake City had turned into an eight hour trip that depleted all the water and food on board.

And another time, he told me, the turbulence was so bad flying into Orlando, that they gave us each a five hundred dollar voucher to try to make up for it. One second my phone was under my leg, and the next it was flying to smack me in the face.

Those sounds wild, I said. But my story is kind of something else entirely.

Alright, he said. Let's hear it then.

<span class="words-section-break"></span>

Flying into Seattle we took a long way around: out past the Olympic Peninsula and back east for landing. They didn't ever mention why. As we made our descent towards the endless clouds blanketing a wintered western Washington, our plane hit thick air that held us at elevation, and slowed the plane swiftly and softly. As if we were landing on a clouded floor of the clouded sky.

Slivers of blue flashed past my window as we tore through the clouded terrain. Engulfed by mountainous fluffs of white and released again and again. The wing ripped through the clouds in streaks, leaving eddies twisting onto themselves.

If you weren't paying attention enough to notice our gradual slowing of speed, or the way the clouds flew by so level above the constant floor of white, you might not have known anything was happening at all. It was only once it was clear we had stopped that everyone seemed to perk up from their mile high haze. Some with faces pressed against the window, others gripping their armrests, or tucked under blankets with headphones in their ears.

I think we were all waiting for something to happen, expecting to fall through and plummet back to earth, or explode. Anything.

The pilot tried starting the engines again, but they only gargled and whimpered and faded. Like a lawn mower starting on too thick grass, or fan drowning in mud. Each moment of thrust ripped a bit of cloud through the engine's blades, but failed to move us. The radio too was either failing to send or failing to receive.

For the adventurous among us, anticipation eventually turned to curiosity. Enough to collect on the wings, look around our white and fluffy void, wondering things like how far it goes, or whether we could stand on the clouds below.

We must be able to, right? One of us said. It's keeping the plane up after all!

Still, when someone sat themselves on the wings edge and jumped to the clouds, we all gasped a bit inside, if not audibly. They fell as fast as you would expect until they reached the layer of clouds, which slowed them so smoothly that none of us could tell the moment they touched down.

A smile grew across their face as they twirled with outstretched arms, lifting and swirling the clouds around them with joy. Water drops condensed on their hair and skin. It's cool, they told us, but comforting too.

More of us followed, and swam in the sensations for a time: the hugging drag of walking through the dense air, the tickle of the freshest dew on our skin. Then we got to forming a plan. Four groups of two, each equipped with drinks, snacks and floatation vests in case of emergency, would split up and walk in different directions to survey the cloud field, agreeing to meet back at the plane in two hours. Another group searched the area around the plane to see if we couldn't figure out what was holding it up.

One group came back one short: they had found an edge of our clouded world. Another found a spot where the floor sagged and softened to stretchy white-gray. Another found nothing but more clouds, as far as they could see. And the last group, who came back twenty minutes late, brought news of what they could only describe as some kind of magic.

We never did find out how the plane was holding.

A half an hour into our trek to the supposed magic we heard whirring in the distance. Not the kind of metal though, and not consistent either. I imagined the sound to be of a bubble machine if made by natural forces. Like a short and purposeful wind turning on and off. In some places here the cloud floor rippled in small hills that undulated with the sound — more so the further we went.

We could feel the gusts the closer we came, and saw emerging puffs coming from a hazy floor in an open piece of sky. As the clouds we stood on rippled and moved with the wind, a gap would form at the source, for a moment, before the whirring would start and fill it in.

Is this where clouds are born? One asked. None of us could come up with anything else.
So yeah, we discovered a cloud machine? And all we could do was stare.

Woah what, he said, and nothing else for a while. Then laughed, realizing, he said, that I was messing with him. But I wasn’t, I told him. It was all completely true.

Then, he asked, how did you ever get down?

That’s the most frustrating part of the story, I told him. I don’t remember at all.

And the other people on the plane?

Yeah, no idea. I said. I've tried to look up names I remember hearing or find the list of passengers who were on that flight. But I've had no luck in confirming that any of them somehow made it too.

He looked at me deeply, trying to find some truth, some proof of deception in my eyes. Then his gaze floated to the clear summer sky, his mind lost in the clouds, trying to put himself there, trying to imagine it all.
