summary: "A man in the park is on the phone with an old sick friend."
---

The sun was beginning to set on a day that felt like a lifetime. The man sat on a boulder on the edge of the path, with his phone pressed against his ear.
	"Well I'm sorry to hear it Jack." Said the man on the other end of the call. "I really am. I thought for sure she was going to be the one."
	Jack shrugged to himself. "Oh, what's another few years alone? I don't got too many good ones left anyhow."
	He kicked at the gravel, and looked over at the small dog sitting nearby.
	"Ya know, at least I don’t have Cancer or nothing. You got the real problems Bob. You need to take care of yourself now. I mean it."
	The scrappy white fluff sat lethargically in the grass, leash-less but seemingly unaware of his freedom. Not much in this world would appear more at ease than he seemed then.
	"Lord knows I'm trying Jack. This shits really kicking my ass though."
	"Yeah. Yeah, I hear ya."
	Both sides were quiet for a moment.
	"Well okay, see ya Bob. I’m going to go finish giving this boy a walk." He said, and flipped closed the phone.
	The man stood, but the dog didn’t budge—whether content or defeated, you couldn't be sure.
	"What do you wanna do? Huh?" He asked the creature at his feet. "What should we do?"
	The dog lifted its head, in no hurry at all, as if the sound of the man's voice—the most exciting thing around—was still mostly uninteresting. The man slid his phone in his pocket and walked the gravel path past his companion. The dog groaned as he made his way from blades to pebbles, but then his effort faded. His legs trudged forward more slowly now, as if being dragged through mud or, it seemed, propelled by an inability to stand.
	"What’s the matter Wolf?" Said the man.
	Wolf bobbed his heavy head, then prepared again to stumble and hope that he missed the ground.
