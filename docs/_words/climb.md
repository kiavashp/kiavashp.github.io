I start in a room on the bottom floor
and climb until I can climb no more
every room just like the one before
same gaping cracks, and same locked doors

I stick my head out the shattered window
to hear from those above me
listen for a secret code
for wisdom in their spoken word

There are tales from the floors below
of weeping from deaths final blow
and the top floor, where it's been told
gold leaf frames an open door

and of those who climbed back down
or have fallen from it's golden crown
who've met the same hooded friend
whose playground is the bottom end

as I sit to ponder what I hear
wind blowing through my ragged hair
I stop to see a bird outside
perched on a branch about to fly

white stripes stretch from its beak
to a golden belly between its feet
it whistles through its gentle song
and soars up past these broken walls
