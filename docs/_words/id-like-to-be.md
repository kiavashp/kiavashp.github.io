I’d like to be the sky
when it burns at dusk
or the moon
when starlight isn’t enough

I’d like to be a licorice fern
perched high on a maple tree
Or a leaf above its humble roots
falling to meet them slowly

I’d like to be a songbird
waiting for Spring
or the forest floor
when it starts to rain

or the moss that climbs
for generations between
a rotting stump
and the canopy

a fallen branch
whose flesh decays
while it sees the forest
in a different way

I don’t want these things
though it may seem
to know their pain
or for novelty

but to feel a little more deeply
the earth beneath our feet
