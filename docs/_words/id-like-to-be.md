I’d like to be the sky
when it burns at dusk
or the moon
when starlight isn’t enough

I’d like to be a licorice fern
perched on a maple tree
or a leaf above its humble roots
falling to meet them slowly

I’d like to be a songbird
waiting for Spring
or the forest floor
when it starts to rain

The moss that climbs
for generations between
a rotting stump
and the canopy

a fallen branch
whose flesh decays
while seeing the forest
in a different way

I don’t want these things
though it may seem
to know their pain
or for novelty

but to feel a little more deeply
the earth, as it shifts beneath our feet
