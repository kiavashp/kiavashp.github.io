I’d like to be the sky
when it burns at dusk
or the moon
glowing in starlight above

I’d like to be a licorice fern
perched high on a maple tree
Or a leaf, grown from roots
falling to meet them slowly

I’d like to be a songbird
waiting for Spring
or the forest floor
when it starts to rain

or the moss that climbs
for generations between
a rotting stump
and the canopy

a fallen branch
a drop on a leaf
water trickling in
a mountain stream

branches creak in
the coming breeze
and all I can think
is "I’d like to be"
