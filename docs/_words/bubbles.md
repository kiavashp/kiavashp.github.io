I’m pretty sure bubbles are magic, and he was well versed in the art.

Inflating with a gentle glide of the wrist, seeming to come alive as they floated. Wobbling from nondescript to shapes that for moments appeared a cloud, or a hippo, or flower. Then as quick as they came would wobble back to blobs undulating in the breeze.

When I thought to check the time two hours had passed since his floating films of soap first caught my eye. The awareness of how entranced I had become, how distracted from my evening walk, rose unexpectedly from the depths of my consciousness. Thoughts no longer encompassing me were becoming clear. How carefully I noted the distorted reflections in their surface. Wondering how much the apparent objects were formed by the bubbles shape, or the streaks of clouds and burning sky contouring the bulbous plane.

My feet moved to leave — to get home to my family, my book and tea. Then, I only later realized, found myself lost again in awe of this sorcerer of soap, this artist of light and air, transforming these elements to objects serene.

As the light faded the bubbles dimmed, though somehow the objects manifested no less clear. The warm light of sunset now deep gradients of blue sky speckled with glimmering stars and distant street lights.

And the magician of bubbles carried on, waving his wands with grace. Forms inflating and lifting from their rings, shimmering into wondrous moments before collapsing in the night.

When I came to again I found the park had quieted and his audience dwindled. Only I — and a few ducks sitting on the lakeshore — remained witness to his work.

As if feeling my awareness shift, he took his eyes from the bubble he'd just released into the night, watched me for a moment, then smiled. Without much thought, and after some hesitation, I stepped forward and opened my mouth, but struggled to find words.

"Hello." He said softly, a bit surprised. "You've been watching for a while."

"How do you do it?" I found myself blurting out. "Those shapes. They're so... defined."

He took a moment — looking up at the bubble shifting from strawberry to formlessness — as if considering it for the first time. "How does your mind know when to wake, or your chest when to breathe? Or your mouth and tongue dance together, giving form to sound?"

I was taken aback by the question. "I — I don't know." I muttered.

"Nor I." He said, truthfully. "Only that it requires my presence. And beyond that, no decision is mine."

We exchanged a few words, and I thanked him deeply. Then I made my way home.

I offered him money but he wouldn't accept it — claiming his work was a reward enough. How could that be? I thought, and insisted, but he only returned a smile.

His words rang in my mind for the rest of the night. Bringing waves of joy, confusion, and utter frustration. It was a lovely thought to be sure, but did he really not understand how from bubbles those objects were formed? Would he have me believe it was not something he worked tirelessly to cultivate? That an ability so marvelous was instead spontaneously bestowed, or one he discovered himself in possession of?

I look for him whenever I pass through the park, hoping for answers, or just to witness those bubbles again. But I haven't seen him since.

I asked around and can't find anyone else who was there that night, or has otherwise heard of anyone like him.

Eventually I settled into a kind of half-baked belief that what I experienced was magic or that there exists more of the world that I don't understand.

But still, it occurs to me now, there's something else that's stuck with me. Something that might have come from watching for him, and faded into a general watching of the world. I often find myself noticing things I didn't before. Small things like the way the light scatters and fades as the sky shifts to night, or the rhythm of a leaf that dances in the wind, or how watching ripples on the lake makes me feel — like movement and stillness can exist all at once.
