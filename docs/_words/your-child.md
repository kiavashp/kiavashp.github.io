If your child is a bowling ball thrown down a lane
you are the faulty bumpers, merely guiding the game
You're not the bowler who decided the direction they threw
or the scoring machine that ensures it's played fair and true

If you birthed a hiker, destined for the hills
You are not the trail, but a map, sparsely filled
You're a broken compass in a world with many souths
and norths which are harder to come about

If you're creating a painting, you are the brush
who may believe their power is just not enough
whose colors are defined by your seasons
or a canvas of your own, for no particular reason

You are only the bumpers
who for a little while
will guide their wandering roll

You are only the map
who though wrinkled and wet
will save them from a trench or two

You are only the brush
who while feeling you aren't enough
flows paint constantly from their bristles

And your child is a ball
who can roll on their own

Your child is a hiker
who will discover themselves as they go

Your child is a painting
still fragile and wet

who may one day have
a painting of their own
