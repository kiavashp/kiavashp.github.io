Beyond the reach of the fires glow, light faded with the hours; but here it remained, as long as there was wood to feed.

He sat in his chair, thinking, and drinking. Held there by the lingering presence of their memory. Like wood to the flames, the amber in his cup gave them life again.

The fire danced to the sounds of the burning wood. While lost in the flames, the creaking felt natural, like the chatter of close company. Then his attention would drift, and the room return, painted cavernous by the crackling that mocked incessantly.

The house had been empty for years, now blanketed in dust that caked in the corners and cracks. The chestnut floor, in spots once shadowed by furniture, had faded with the rest of the boards. Perhaps the only proof that he lived there were the tracks across the living room floor: weaving from the rug to the kitchen and the bare mattress that was pushed into the corner. The cold expanse of the house could send his thoughts to unpleasant places.

A sharp chill squeezed through the crack between the doors. He sat for a while, watching the chill swirl around, disturbing the warmth. He grabbed the bottle from the floor, topped off his glass, and groaned out of his chair to add a log to the fire. Then returned to sitting stoic, his arms on the rests, not moving except to occasionally push against the rug — rocking once or twice before returning to stillness — or to coat his throat and let it burn.

The rug was worn to threads where colored blocks were piled and toppled and piled happily again. Or pushed through the wool tufts to an engine sputtering through clenched lips. Beside him two lines pressed into the rug where the other rocking chair sat: the one he traded the week before for the bottle that fed his glass. He told himself he wouldn't do it unless he really had to. Not that it mattered anymore, with the house being reclaimed. Tomorrow morning they'd come, all this way, "to pick up the keys," they said. Though he knew it was really to make sure he hadn't burned the place down.

He thought about the boy. About how he'd grown on him — even started to feel like his own, near the end. It was during a fight with the boy's mother that he realized this. About something he wasn't doing right, or should have been saying. About his failings as a father figure, or being a bad influence in some other way. He couldn't remember anymore. They left that evening with the camping gear and just about the whole damn pantry. It was something they'd done before, for a night or two at a time.

It occurred to him, quite unpleasantly, that if they were still here he would be doing much the same thing: just staring into the flames, as she would have called it, waiting for life to happen. A discomfort surfaced and spread across his skin. "Why does this not count as living?" He would ask earnestly, or say, "You two are my life now," depending on his mood. He shifted in his chair, repositioning twice before settling again.

A week passed and they hadn't returned. He came to searching the property every evening, until it was too dark to see. He wasn't usually one to worry. In a clearing on the creek's bank a tree lay across their tent, covered in mud and torn to shreds by scavengers. It must have fallen while they slept.

He'd spent so long telling himself tomorrow wouldn't come. He'd find a way to pay; apply for another extension. If only he could make them see that he was doing his damned best. He'd get a loan from elsewhere — the one thing he tried, without success. He'd march down and tell them to their face what they were doing, what they were taking away from a man who'd always come by things honestly.

"No-good bastards." He muttered to himself.

A log split into two charred spears and crumbled through the grate. Cold air rushed in to take its place, pulling a slight draft. It would need feeding soon, but his body resisted, his position in the chair feeling more permanent.

The evening darkened and the cold encroached. His back hunched and stiffened, holding as if to avoid losing the heat that found him. Memories of pies and pastries passed through his mind. The scent of warm spices that imbued the air with abundance, the steam from the oven that hugged for hours, the touch of her hand when they were finished baking, reminding him what love felt like.

Memory isn't the same as life, he thought — words that suddenly meant everything to him.

After much thought and more time, he lifted himself in a series of creaks and moans. Only a few twigs remained in the basket beside the hearth — which caught quickly as he threw them in — and a twisted log that sat under many piles before: impossible to split, and assumed too massive to move alone. But the alternative was to surrender to the cold. He set down his glass and lifted with both hands. The log pulled at his back, threatening to shear muscle off bone as he waddled over to the dwindling flames. It fell hard on the grate, playing it like a bell, and lifting a cloud from the pile of ash beneath. The small gust it made nearly blew out the fire.

The howling wind forced moans from the walls and rattled the windows in their frames. He turned suddenly at the sounds, as if to an intruder. The wind blew again, knocking the back doors against the trim in quick succession. He shuddered, unable to help it, and let out a stuttered breath. It's funny, he thought, how the world makes you feel. He fell back in his chair, and they creaked together in a deeper embrace. The impact shook the room as a sudden gust blew open the doors. He shivered as it pushed its way around him, but didn't care to get up or do anything else about it.

The twisted log eventually caught, and burned, and dwindled — rising as air again, or falling as ash. His consciousness faded with the glowing coals, and his thoughts swirled in and out of reality. Desires rose and materialized as his mind unwound, feeling tangible in the way they only do in dreams.

The space around him tightened, as if the walls were closing in. He felt the floor quiver and a moment later the house lifted from the ground. It was drifting away, to a place where they couldn't take it from him; somewhere he could live in this room — in their presence — forever. A place without lenders who come and take what is yours. Away from a world that punished his dealings with pain. It was the solution, so elegant, so effortless; why had he not thought of it before?

The house floated higher, getting lighter as it did, and with it he rose into clearer skies. The chipped paint, the splintered wood, the blemishes of age, all softened in the light, and the house regained its splendor.

Then a streak of reality, with all its weight, swirled back around to tell him this wasn't real. He resisted for a moment, then opened his eyes and looked outside — just to be sure. It was dark now, and quiet. The porch sat wet and weathered in the moonlight, and the trees held thick against the property line that descended towards the creak. The sight of it all stung, draining life from him. His head sank to his chest and he wrestled with what threatened to consume him.

Coming face to face with his surrender sent him into a panic. He flailed, trying to resurface, but found that he couldn't. His head was held firmly below water by temperamental defeat, rendering him unable to breath for moments he thought would never end.

On one forced plunge he noticed an anger rising in bubbles from the depths. The hands of defeat lightened on him again, for a moment, but he didn't resurface. He stayed gazing into the dark as the bubbles passed over him — the air of anger tickling his face. When they surfaced and the water cleared, he took a look beneath. A stifling fear swirled below, mockingly. A fear of an uncertain future and unending frustrations. He watched in awe and waited: for it to disappear, for more bubbles to rise. Something. Anything.

His frustration faded to hopelessness, and he didn't fight back. It felt good to surrender, in a way, so he let himself sink further into cold and barren waters. Numbness overtook him, or an aimless pain that he didn't understand. Something spoke to him then. Maybe a preoccupation with a peaceful death, or whatever it is that lies on the other side of defeat. Let go, it whispered softly, from no particular direction.

His mouth opened and throat fell limp, releasing the last of the air from his lungs. After a brief panic a calm crept in, deepening his voluntary loss of control. He looked up once more, to the weakening light, being swallowed by the darkness that filled his view. In some approximation of mourning, he watched it fade, until the light was indistinguishable from his memory of it.

He sunk further from himself and the world he knew, into the darkness that now consumed. His body began losing form, falling away in the dark. Everything looked the same above and around, so he turned down and pulled himself deeper. A rush of cool water swept across his face. He scanned the space below for a time, looking for some break in the absence of light.

The slightest glimmer appeared in the distance. It flickered softly, and pulsed, and disappeared, repeatedly and seemingly all at once. Like a floater that jumps around in your eye, changing form, or an illusion fed by a desperate search for light. He dove towards it frantically, slowing only to search again when he lost sight of it.

He slowed to a crawl as he approached the glimmer light. Luminous shapes moved behind shadowed wisps, distorting or obstructing his view. Closer, he could make out two figures playing on a rug, before doors that were swung open to a warm autumn day. The trees spread across the hills in fiery shades under a bright and open sky. They were playing just as they had before, in the room as it was now, with the lone rocking chair, the mattress in the corner, and the dusty faded floors. The strength of their presence grew with each moment, radiating a warmth that fed.

He would be with them again, forever this time. The thought overwhelmed, and filled him with joy. Tears seeped into the water, swirling with the cold, and further warping his view. But it felt good to feel, and so completely, for the first time he could remember. He tried hysterically to swim and called out to them, but he got no closer and no sound came. His body was falling away — something he'd forgotten. He grew increasingly weak. Then, as if she heard his silent screams, she looked up and smiled. He reached out to her glowing figure and opened for an embrace. But as his hand touched the light, it pulsed and flickered out. His consciousness collapsed, and the darkness itself fell away, leaving nothing.

His body went limp and no longer shivered. The glass dropped from his hand and shattered on the floor. The coals were long since cold and the house was still; the wind through the open doors was all that moved.

The night settled slowly and the trees quietly creaked. Wisps of leaves reflected traces of moonlight as they twirled and scraped across the floor. Then tumbled silently onto the carpet, burying it further. The wind and the leaves lifted streaks of dust through the night, restoring, in the pale light, some of the wood's former glow. But in his mind nothing changed, and no time passed at all.

Consciousness eventually found him again, thawed by the rays of sun through the skylight. He woke to their warmth so vibrant and real. On the rug beside him they played together, full of life. Morning sun poured through the open doors, exposing the room to the endless beauty of the world. Birds were singing to celebrate the break of day — or he thought, his arrival to this place. The trees yawned and stretched their limbs, waving to the sky.

By some miracle he'd made it to them, and just when he thought he lost them again.

A frigid breeze tickled his neck. His foot switched and hit something hard. Awareness of his body returned suddenly and he hesitated before opening his eyes. His head whipped around and he threw himself from his chair for a few hurried steps. His back pulled against him and his foot screamed — he'd stepped on the shards of glass. He squeezed his ankle and tumbled to the leaf covered floor.

He felt a fool lying there, squirming in pain. He looked around for an excuse or a distraction. The rug was buried, the floor was faded, and the sky was closing gray. He hadn't made it to them — of course he hadn't. This was still the world of the living. He took the empty bottle and hurled it against the hearth. The resounding shatter stung his ears. Grains of glass danced across the room, and he watched, unmoving, the place where the bottle broke, marked by a dark stain on the bricks.

He huffed violently at the littered room; it was the bank's problem now, he told himself. But anger didn't find him as it so often had, despite him having taunted it, invited it in. And something about its absence was unnerving. He found himself searching, wanting the anger there. Just to resolve this feeling that hung like the emptiness of an unanswered call.

The patter of delicate feet made their way across the roof, then stopped. The world was quieter than he remembered it.

He picked the glass from his skin. Thoughts of the future flooded his mind. Where he'd live, where he'd sleep, what could possibly do for work anymore. He adjusted his grip to check the side of his foot for more glass, then switched to check the other. The leaves crunched beneath him as he shifted on the floor. And above him the quiet hung, though he couldn't for the life of him pick out any missing sound.

Standing at the patio doors it struck him again. Maybe some of the false joy he woke up to had lingered. Or his mind, for the first time, had slowed enough to hear the calm of the world. Beyond the birds singing, the wind brushing the trees, and the creek trickling in the distance, was a silence, so gentle and full. One he couldn't remember hearing before.

The sun was warm against his face, he could feel it now. And the sky was as vibrant as it had ever been, like it was shimmering with life. He turned back to the empty room, which seemed a bit brighter, and let his mind settle, rediscover its place. It spoke of a desire to have them close, to experience the world he woke to again. But with the room in disarray, and for years before neglected, he struggled to relive his daydream. Fragments of sights and sounds were all he could manage, and still they flickered in and out as his focus shifted.

He made his way to the kitchen and searched the cabinets for a broom. After some time he found one, and the dustpan too. He collected the broken glass and swept the leaves back out to the porch. Then dragged the mattress down the hall as far as he could bear and left it there. This wasn't his house anymore, but in a way he couldn't explain, and wouldn't dare claim aloud, it would always be theirs. And there's no reason why they shouldn't have a swept rug to play on.

He stepped through the front door and leaned against the frame. He looked back at the room and lingered for a moment — his feet resisting the stillness — for one more silent conversation.

He apologized, in a way, and in so many words. She asked where he would sleep. He still had no answer, except to say that wherever it was, "it will be with you."

He left the keys under the mat, and walked in no particular direction. The emptiness wasn't gone, but more familiar now — like a hopelessness so deep that it liberated. And his sorrow burned with a yearning to be fed, by the rays of sun and the shades of green, the chatter of creatures and the touch of the breeze, and the feeling of the ground pressed against his tender feet, reminding him what love feels like.
