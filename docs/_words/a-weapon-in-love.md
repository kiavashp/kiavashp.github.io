Upon these aching shoulders I hold
a tower of arguments getting old
wielded like a giant sword
built in our many battles before

layer by layer over the years
held together by crusted tears
piles we carry with us now
to swing, when threatened, above our rusted crowns

staggering below their massive weight
swinging in hopes to "set things straight"
until we both grow tired and weak
fuming and barely able to speak

I fear for our future, if I'm being true
that soon the weight will outgrow us two
one swing and the piles will collapse to dust
covering all that we ever knew as Us

And what if we find, after so many years
the Us we knew became the piles we feared
that our bond is now built upon
the times we *didn't* get along

Will this be how our love ends?
from decades ago between two dear friends
to watching the dust settle on
the love we had told ourselves was strong
