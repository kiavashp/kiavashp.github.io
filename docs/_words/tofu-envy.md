"The tofu was amazing, Babe." He said, gathering the last streaks of sauce from his bowl.

She smiled as she fixed another bite and lifted it to her mouth.

"I love you. So much." He said, pausing for a moment in admiration.

She gazed up at his slender face towering behind the pendant lamp. He pushed back his chair and took his dishes to the sink, returning with what remained of the wine. Her eyes fell to the browned edges of the white textured cube on her fork. She took a bite and contemplated.

"I've made better,” she said with a shrug.

His smiling eyes rolled as he refilled her glass, then his own, and set the bottle between them.

"This one time, with Paul, we made some BOMB tofu," she said. "It was SO good. His whole family loved it, especially his grandma." A satisfied laugh trickled out of her.

He narrowed his eyes, as if to flinch, and reached for her plate. "You done?" He asked. She gave him a blank, expectant stare. After a moment of silence, he stacked hers with the serving plates and brought them to the kitchen.

"So, what movie should we watch tonight?" He asked as he began rinsing the dishes. "It's your turn to pick."

"Uhm," she uttered abruptly, then looked out the window. The darkness appearing to pull her.

"Debra?"

She stared for a moment more. "I don't know! Why do I have to pick?"

He shut off the tap. "Is everything okay? You've been acting... off tonight."

Her eyes searched desperately for words. Anything but the ones that pushed firm against her lips. "I think Paul might be here soon,” she blurted out. She sank slightly in her chair.

"You mean, tonight?" His voice quivered.

A sound bubbled from inside her and fell flat on her lips. "Heh."

Confusion and concern fought to consume his face.

A stream of thoughts flashed rapidly in her mind, options for what she could say. All equally stupid, she thought.

"It'll be quick." She finally assured him. "I promise."

But her preceding pause, she thought, already planted seeds of doubt firmly in his mind. Seeds that would grow wild soon.

"He's just driving down to his parents for the holidays. He was supposed to stop by this morning, but he got delayed." She tried to veil her gasps for air.

Confusion faded to skepticism, though his cheeks still reddened. Shifting slightly in his stance — though not enough for either to notice. Her body stiffened, but of this she was also unaware.

"Just to pick up his carving stuff." She clarified.

He spoke, hesitantly, as if regret had found firm footing in him before the words ever left his mouth. "Can't he get them another day?"

"I know. I tried to tell him," although that wasn't entirely true, "but he's just really OCD about that kind of thing. And I've had them for months." She wanted to stop, to let him respond. Please, say something, anything! She thought. Why does this always happen to me?

"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. We can do another date night tomorrow, or Wednesday before we go to your family's."

His face twitched as he forced an unsettled smile. He turned back to the dishes. "No, it's okay."

Tears threatened to flood her eyes. She moved to put away the leftovers, but he shot an arm out before she made it past him. "It's okay. I got it." Their gazes clashed, stretching time while the water ran. She returned to the table and to the night that was settling outside.

"Why do you have his tools anyway?"

"He was teaching me how to carve a spoon. Before he moved away."

<span class="words-section-break"></span>


The window glowed like lighthouse walls as headlights swept across them. Their eyes met. He took a sip from his mug, and was slow to move it from his face.

"You don't have to meet him you know." She said, suddenly overwhelmed by the thought.

"No, no. That's ridiculous," he said, as if to convince himself. "It's about time."

Debra flashed a tense smile, and trying not to roll her eyes, disappeared down the hall.

There was a knock. Mark looked towards their room, waiting for her return. Another knock. His slender legs wavered as he inched towards the door.

"Hello! You must be Mark." A scrawny figure stood before him, no taller than his chest. "It's nice to finally meet you!" The man said, with compensatory enthusiasm.

"Hey." He fiddled with the door knob. "Debra just went down the hall. Should be back soon."

"No worries! What has it been, a year now that you've been dating?" Paul stepped inside, slow at first, then hurried.

Mark closed the door behind him. He ran his finger around the knob another time, checked the hall again, then walked towards the kitchen. "Yeah, a year and a half almost."

"Nice!" Paul said, taking in the room. "This place is... awesome."

Mark put the last pot and cooking utensils in the sink, and watched as the faucet ran over them. "So, how was the drive?"

"Good! Not bad at all. Just a little snow in the Sierras, but other than that it was pretty clear."

"Where from again? Oregon?" Said Mark, still watching the dishes slowly submerge.

"Paul!" Came a voice barreling out of darkness, and wrapping tight around Paul. "Sorry! I was looking for your carving stuff."

"Oh shit! Debs!" Paul said as he turned to reciprocate her embrace. "How the hell is it going?"

"Oh you know, just out here living my best life!" She radiated.

"Hell yeah. It's kind of weird seeing you in your own place." He let out a short chuckle.

"You like the aesthetic?" She said, scanning the room.

"Love it. Boho chic, right?"

The smile widened on her face.

Mark was still standing silently at the sink.

"Is that a stir-fry I smell?" Paul said, nostrils flaring. "Mongolian Fried Tofu perhaps?"

"You know it!" She said. "I was just telling Mark about that first time we made it."

"Never made it as good since." He said in playful frustration. "Must have been something in the air that night."

She flashed a look at Mark. "Dude, your grandma was so funny! She would not stop talking about it for hours!"

"All week." Paul corrected. "She still brings it up sometimes. But she can never remember the name, so she just calls it 'Debra's food.'"

The two of them burst into laughter. Mark joined in with a reluctant snicker.

"I miss your grandma." She said as her laughing settled.

"Well, I'm here for two weeks! You should come down and visit! We'll do one of our cooking nights, just like old times." Paul said, then turned to Mark. "You should come too!"

Another flimsy laugh dribbled from Mark's lips. "Yeah, maybe."

"We're going to his parents for Christmas and New Years," Debra interjected, "so we might not have time. And he needs to study over the break." She said as she rolled her eyes. "But I'll definitely try!"

"Oh yeah. Med school right?"

"Yeah."

They moved to the kitchen, and Debra pulled up an extra chair.

"Water?" Mark asked rhetorically, and brought three glasses over to the table.

Paul and Debra caught up for a while longer, laughing and smiling and reminiscing <like childhood friends, or former lovers>. Mark looked uncomfortably disengaged, interjecting with a topic change every once in a while, none of which stuck.

<span class="words-section-break"></span>


Debra was increasingly aware of the distance growing between them and Mark. Paul must have been too, for his enthusiasm dwindled, further feeding her frustration. Mark's silence and blank stare pulled like brakes on their conversation, slowing it to a mere crawl. Another pause and it dropped into a pregnant silence that swelled as it lingered.

She was the first to speak. “Okay, well you should probably get go —“

"Mark, can I ask you something?" Paul interrupted, then paused as if surprised by his words.

Debra whipped her head around, confused at first, then tentatively shocked. No, he wouldn't. He better fucking not. But she couldn't say a word.

"Why are you so uncomfortable with Deb and I?" The words stumbled from his mouth.

Shit. She thought. It's out now... Her violent eyes stabbed at Paul's stoic face. He wouldn't turn to look at her; he must have known how she would feel. Paul placed his hands in a fist on the table.

"Is it just because we've kissed? Because we had a friendship that wasn't strictly platonic? I hate that this is getting in the way of your relationship, because it really shouldn't." He rushed, like he was expecting to be interrupted. "So just tell me why you're uncomfortable and we can address it right now and finally move on from this nonsense."

"No, I'm — What the —" He looked over at Debra with accusation in his eyes and desperation in his voice.

Their silence deepened, and the room conspired, falling away and taking with it the comfort it once held. There was only the small circular table, with the three of them around, and the lamp hanging from the darkness, radiating what it could of its warmth.

She looked to Mark, then to Paul; her eyes hung on the window for a moment. "What the fuck Paul? Now is seriously not the time."

She saw a wave of guilt wash over him, then recede. It seemed to only further feed his fear of leaving this unresolved. He was visibly more committed now, and it scared her.

"I know. I just — It's been long enough Deb." He turned to Mark. "Dude, you genuinely seem like a good dude, but every time this comes up, every time she feels your discomfort, I know it just drives you apart. I hate knowing that she feels guilty now, and like she needs to hide our completely platonic connection. All because your brain is scavenging for all the justification it can find to feed your paranoid thoughts. Like those letters we sent: A desperate attempt to mend our broken friendship, that you were sure was some kind of romantic confession."

"I did not think that —" Mark turned to Debra, almost in a whisper, "you told him?" A rush of blood tinted his face.

"Of course she fucking told me man! Because she's scared and frustrated and doesn't know what to do. It pisses me off that we have to do this stupid little dance just because you can't trust her. I care about her, therefore I care about you. So, ask me literally anything. I'm an open book. Whatever you want to know."

Debra's legs trembled under the table. She shot Paul a silencing glare.

Mark quivered too — in his face, which had reddened again. "I'm not jealous or anything." He paused. "I'm fine."

Paul sighed, turning towards Debra, then back to Mark. "Come on dude. Just — Help me out here. I know you're not —"

The tension broke in Debra, and she burst from her chair. "Oh my god! Can we PLEASE not? This is between us. You do not need to get involved!"

<span class="words-section-break"></span>


Paul hated digging, throwing up dirt, exposing wounds. But the excavation had already started, and now fresh wounds were being made. We're closer to the bottom than the top now. He told himself. Just a little further.

"No! I'm not going to keep playing along with this stupid game! Mark is seeing things where they don't exist. You shouldn't have to hide a normal friendship to keep your relationship from falling apart. It's fucking ridiculous! I'm not going to let you go through that again." Paul demanded. "Now Mark, what do you want to know? What's so threatening about my friendship with Debs?" He asked, more aggressive now.

Debra looked at Mark for the first time in a while, with a face that seemed to say "I'm sorry," or "I can't handle this right now." Though Mark appeared to take it as proof of abandonment. She pushed back her chair and walked off.

"Okay. Fine. Uhm —" Mark said, slow to start. "Did you ever do anything more than kiss?" His body language said he was standing his ground, but his face winced slightly as he heard the words escape him.

Paul looked back at Debra, who watched from couch in the unlit living room. Her eyes were desperate, her body restless. She looked like she wanted to scream, then turned to Mark and her face sunk. She curled up her legs, and buried her face in her arms.

Paul took a deep breath and locked eyes with Mark again. "Let's save that question for last."

Red became maroon, and continued to cover his face, tensing further with every exchange. "So you did? And Debra's been lying to me?"

"Okay, calm down —"

"No! So I'm not crazy! I knew there was more!"

"Mark!" His voice bellowed. "I'm not answering the question because no matter what I say, it's not going to help! I asked you what you're scared of. Why is it threatening?"

Muted cries bubbled from the shadows behind them.

"Let's say we did sleep together." Paul continued. "Then what? We'd be no different from the past relationships she's had. And do those threaten you?"

The cries deepened, bordering on convulsions, though the men were too involved to notice.

Mark was silent; a towering, blood-stained stone.

"At the end of the day it doesn't matter what we did. That's not what bothers you. You're not scared of the past. You're scared of the future. But why?" Paul said, trying to play it cool, but clearly simmering inside.

Mark rolled his eyes in reluctant submission. "Did you two ever date?"

"Dude. Really? Again, why does that matter?"

"It didn't matter, but it does now! I can't trust either of you anymore. And we were doing just fine before you got here." Mark huffed. "Not everything's about you."

"You can, trust me. I told you, I want to be completely open."

"Do you really? Because you're oh for two man." He stared threateningly, as if taking the upper hand.

Paul straightened his back, and his eyes widened.

How do you convince someone you're trying to help? How do you show them you're not here to argue? Are good intentions not enough to ease someone's mind? Do they even matter at all? Maybe feeling defensive is kind of self fulfilling, in a way.

"Yes. Really. But I won't let you feed your insecurities until you're overwhelmed, self justified and miserable. I won't let you self-sabotage like that." Paul paused, exasperated now. "I don't — I didn't know this would be so hard. I'm just trying to help, so you two can be happier. But I feel like I'm making things worse."

He looked down at the shadow that spilled from his tight fists on the table. "You know how much she loves you, right?"

Mark's shoulders started to relax, but he was still tense — extremely so — and hungry for answers. "Do you love her?"

Paul hesitated. "No. Not romantically."

Mark interrogated him with piercing eyes, but decided to continue. "Did you ever have feelings for her?"

Paul sighed again. "There was one time I thought I might, but we both realized later we were just desperate for love."

He thinks, and digs further. "So she thought she liked you too?"

"Dude, really? I'm being fully honest with you. You have to believe I am. I told you, I have nothing to hide, but you have to take what I say at face value. I'm not glossing over details, or spewing white lies to protect your feelings."

"How do I know that?" He said, then bowed his head in frustration and recomposed himself. "I just want all the facts. And how can I ever trust the truth when it's been hidden from me for so long? How can I ever trust her again?"

Paul's heart sank in his chest, and for the first time that night, he noticed Debra's cries. Tears balled up in the corner of his eyes, but he fought against them. "Look man. We never dated. And even when we were under the delusion that we might want something more than friendship, we doubted it and changed our minds every day. If we really wanted to be in a relationship, we had plenty of chances." He paused, his eyes a bit kinder now, but with a hint of condescension. "How about this. Ask me on a scale of one to ten, how likely I think it is that we'll ever get together. Even if, hypothetically, we were both single the rest of our lives. Even if you weren't in the picture."

"Okay. Okay, I get it man."

"No, really. Ask me. I don't want you to be scared of me or our past. I want to give you answers, and I want you to believe it."

Mark's eyes performed a dramatic roll. "Fine. Tell me."

"Two. Maybe even one."

Mark looked surprised, almost offended, behind his tentative relief.

"Not because I don't think she's a great person." Paul clarified, and felt the rabbit hole on who's edge he was precariously perched. The one he'd been dancing around so desperately. "Okay. Have you never met someone you cared so deeply about, but were utterly incompatible with?"

Mark said nothing, but his face said tell me more.

"Maybe you were extremely comfortable around each other. Maybe your sense of humor was spookily similar. Maybe you tried to make it work, but something always felt like it was missing. You might have gone through your relationship with a fine tooth comb, or blamed each other for what the other wasn't doing right — what you thought was keeping it from working. But ultimately — if you're lucky — you realize the only thing wrong with your relationship was what you were trying to force it into something it didn't want to be. It takes a lot more than getting along to have a successful life partner — I don't have to tell you that. And that's all it was, with Debs and I. We just never had what it took. If anything, you should take comfort in knowing that despite all the pressure from everyone around us to date, the desperation we both felt in the wake of our last heartbreaks, and all the hopeful lies we told ourselves, there still wasn't a day that went by where we were convinced that we had any chance of actually working."

Debra sat up on the couch and tried to wipe away her drying tears.

"I'm sorry I ruined your date night. But just know, I care deeply for you both. Otherwise, I wouldn't have tried so hard to make sure I wasn't standing in the way of your relationship. I want Debs to be happy, and you seem like her best chance right now. I want to do what I can to support that."

Mark leaned on his arms, and his shoulders dropped, fully this time. His face settled and squinted at the silhouette walking towards him into the warm light.

Paul took one last sip of water, and placed the glass back on the table. "I should get going," he was going to say, but opted to keep quiet. The couple were lost in each other's arms, and didn't notice as he grabbed his carving knives, and walked out the door.

The room began to glow again, and Debra watched from Mark's shoulder as the headlights swept across the window, and turned to illuminate the road ahead.
