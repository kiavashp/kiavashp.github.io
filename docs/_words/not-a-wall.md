I came upon a wall, impossibly tall, that stretched to both horizons. On this side was the world: all people, pleasure, and pain. And on the other, was everything.

Caravans of people, millions strong, marched in both directions; in search of a door, a crack, a way across; crumbling bricks or ground that was soft.

A congregation lay at its foot, passionately speculating its nature. Conversation boiled, arguing this way or that; quoting those who'd come before, or exposing their folly. One by one they choose a direction, and headed off in pursuit of what await them. Some called it enlightenment, others success; others bliss or peace of mind.

I stepped up to the towering divide, to rest my hand upon it. The wall was made of hardened stone, so instead I lay an ear, but silence was all I could hear.

I chose a direction, for none seemed better, and walked it for many years. Past the fallen, the silent, and those who claimed to witness a passage through. They push and ram and mine and dig, but the wall will never budge, and the ground stays firm and true.

There was one who sits, in no apparent pain, under a shaded tree. When I asked how far the wall may go, it became clear they too did not know. “Forever,” they claim, “so sit,” they say, “and revel in its wonder.” I looked upon the path again, with millions afoot, and thought. "No, it cannot be."

I quickened my step, and lengthen my stride, with a newfound desire for the other side. For many more years I continued on, passing alike the elders and strong. Until my legs surrendered, and I fell among the crowd. I laid against the great wall, pondering aloud. "Perhaps the man was right, and the wall goes forever. And if true for this direction, then why not the other?"

Hope began to escape me, and with it went my drive. Then I found myself, in disbelief, on the other side.

At first I thought it a fluke, or maybe death, come too soon. But it was a truth I had been too blind to see, when told by the man beneath the fig tree. It is no mighty wall at all, but a veil, an illusion, most extreme. To reach the other side does not take trying, only being.

I walk along a wall, dividing our world and eternity. I do not seek the end or the other side, but sights I have yet to see. Often with a little more joy, and sometimes without desire or dream. And now when I feel my legs become weak beneath my knees, I repeat over and over, so that one day I may believe. “It’s not a wall, it’s not a wall.” And yet still a wall I see.
