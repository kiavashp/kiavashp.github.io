summary: "Humanity is living in a state of incredible peace for the first time in our history—with each other and the earth—largely thanks to a brain implant that promotes empathy, optimism, and general contentment. But like any technology, this one has bugs too, and Julian is one of them. A debilitating ringing renders him unconscious, and he wakes in a research facility dedicated to cases like his. They still don't understand the source of the problem, but Julian is determined to do anything in his power to get back to his daughter and pregnant wife."
