That was the reaction I got from my childhood friend—and now writing partner—Wyatt, when I first told him, and I understood why. I could imagine him having flashbacks to high school English with Ms. T, wondering how I could possibly be the same kid he knew back then.

I remember sitting in class with fifteen minutes left to finish our essays, when he turns around to check my progress for the fourth time, or maybe fifth—I’d lost track. I still hadn’t decided how I wanted to finish my first sentence. His eyes rolled in desperate frustration, not knowing how to help me. But I didn’t know what to tell him. “Come on dude. Just write something. Anything!” he finally whispered; I’m afraid Ms. T will hear and suspect us of cheating. I lower my head, locking eyes with the white void, and he returns to spewing words effortlessly across the page. Maybe it’s the start of the sentence that needs fixing, I think as I reach for the eraser. *But what do I change? How do I know I’ll even be making it better?* I retract my hand, leaving the eraser where it is. As I attempt to conjure up the perfect opening sentence, I run my pencil over the title again and again. With each stroke I extend the imperfections of the last, until it resembles a crude attempt at calligraphy. *I just need something as clever as my title*, I tell myself, and try to imagine what an essay of that quality might look like. *This sentence isn’t good enough. I can do better.* I grab the eraser and rub the words back off the page. Then the bell rings. Class is over and I lost another battle to the impenetrable blank page. I feel momentary relief as I accept defeat, but the end of my struggles were still more than a decade away.

The pattern continues: essays go unwritten, books are left unread, and my inability to write goes from a riddle I hope to crack, to a flaw I consider immutable. My parents try talking to me for the hundredth time, almost out of habit. My friends quickly go from giving advice to indulging me in my self-deprecating jokes. My grandfather gives me a book he thinks will do the trick, but I don’t read books—that’s half the problem. A few months later he asks if I’ve started reading it yet. I know I won’t finish, but I give it a try anyway—if just to dampen the guilt. I read a page or two, then set it down, and a few days later I try again. This goes on for days, maybe weeks, until I’m a whole twelve pages in before I close it for good.

I failed Ms. T’s class with a startling 43%. A few weeks before the school year ends, she calls me into her classroom. With an intensity and sternness that masked her underlying compassion, she asked if I even cared. I told her I did and tried to explain the discrepancy between my words and my absurdly low grade, but I couldn’t find the words. I told my friends it was because I was lazy, but the truth was I didn’t know why. I waited for her to do what all my other teachers had: offer make up assignments I had no intention of completing. It’s not that I wanted to fail, I just knew it would only add to the overwhelming guilt I felt for failing myself and everyone else who kept pushing me, despite the lack of anything to show for their efforts. Instead, she told me to finish the work for the rest of the year, and left it at that. I could see in her expression that she knew it was too late to save my grade. This conversation was just her attempt at making sure I didn’t find myself here again. It was sophomore year, but she saw where I was headed. Graduation still felt impossibly distant to me, but its looming shadow was just around the corner.

Two years later and I’m staring at another blank essay begging to be written. Again, Ms. T watches over a silent room of bodies hunched over the desks that line the walls. This time it’s for the high school exit exams. I told myself I’d really try this time—set rules even—despite my growing detachment from good grades and an on-time graduation. *Keep your eyes on the page. No going back to “improve” a sentence.* Not even the pure bliss of a calligraphic title was going to tempt me this time!

My determination worked, to a degree. After twenty minutes passed with nothing to show for it, I got my first sentence down. I wanted to erase it immediately. Instead I took a moment to remind myself of my rules, and tried to push through anyway. Before I knew it I had a paragraph, and was anxiously considering a second. I checked the time: there were nine minutes left. *There’s no way I’m finishing this.* I put down my pencil and pondered my fate. Compared to my insurmountable writers block, a fifth year of high school didn’t seem all that bad. It was just a little more time in the same place. It felt tangible, manageable, even a little novel. I imagined it like a normal year, just without the crippling pressure of expectations.

Day two was math and science: subjects that came more naturally to me. I felt a little calmer walking through the door that morning, until she pulled me aside. In her firm eastern European tone she said, “I saw your essay portion. You were the only one who didn’t complete. Stay after and I will let you finish. If you don’t, you won’t graduate.” I knew how generous she was being, bending the rules for me, but I just wanted to tell her another hour or two wasn’t going to help. I knew better than to try and persuade her to let me fail, so I continued quietly to my seat hoping she’d forget.

The other students trickled out and I stayed behind, staring again at the mostly blank page—it turns out she didn’t forget. I don’t know what happened next, but I must have somehow finished. The next thing I remember is walking out of that room, the sun blinding like I hadn’t seen it for days. I spend the following months waiting to be told that I wouldn’t graduate, or would have to take the exam again to get my diploma. But the message never came, and by margins too close for comfort, I walked across the stage with the rest of my class.

Early last year I was unpacking from a move and found that book my grandfather gave me all those years ago. *Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life* by Anne Lamott. A faded movie ticket (Transformers, 2009, $7.75?!?) stuck from its dusty pages. Out of curiosity, or maybe as an excuse to procrastinate unpacking, I pressed the bookmark against the pages and lifted it open—page 12, right where I left it.

I had come to a crossroads at the time. After being a software engineer for more than seven years, I was determined to find a way to make a living doing something I found more meaningful. I had played music for most of my life, took animation in high school, and picked up woodcarving a couple years prior, but there was still something missing. There was a need I hadn’t yet discovered how to satisfy. I remained haunted by my failures to get my thoughts onto a page, but had this urge that wouldn’t go away. I wanted to express the thoughts and views of the world that constantly occupied my mind. In a way, that had always been my favorite thing to do: be present, observe my surroundings, and attempt to understand its nuance. I was always trying to compensate for our habit of convincing ourselves that everything is simple and clear cut. I never knew what to do with any of those ideas though, except to try desperately to fit them into conversation, hoping someone would be willing to explore them with me. *Maybe writing could change that?* I flipped back to the first page and started to read.

This time I made it to the end. And this time, it changed me.

It’s funny, the advice in her book was not too different from what I’d been told back in high school. Maybe it was the way Lamott gave all the ugly details behind the advice, or her ability to show by example how and why to persevere through our most counterproductive thoughts. Or maybe I was just finally ready to listen. Whatever the reason, when I heard it from her, I finally believed it.

I was eventually able to write a story, then another, and if you’re reading this (and you aren’t Wyatt) I guess I wrote my first piece of nonfiction too. But the value I got from those faded pages had nothing to do with finishing a story—though that’s also nice. My mindset changed in surprising ways before I ever sat down to write; while I was growing my pile of failed ideas which still lay dormant, collecting virtual dust; long before I ever finished my first shitty draft of my first crappy story. I finally understood the power and role of fiction. I was able to turn seemingly unrelated negative habits into fuel, even inspiration. I started to see meaning where I hadn’t before, and it was exhilarating. Maybe I was learning what it meant to be an artist.

### An exploration of emotional truth
Everyone has at least one form of art they don’t care for, or even despise. For me that was narrative fiction. I used to wonder why it even existed. Was the truth not good enough? Are real human stories not sufficient? What more do we need to communicate the struggles we experience and life lessons we seek?

That perspective also extended into my thoughts on emotion. I believed it was ok to experience emotions, but that ultimately we should aim to transcend them—that logic and science were all we needed. *Why dwell on how things feel, when you can discover how they actually are?*

I don’t know how to argue against that logic directly, because I think it’s a valid perspective. And exploring the inner-workings of our universe, or subtleties of human behavior, had always given me as much a sense of wonder and meaning as fiction seemed to give others. But behind that obsession with logic, I now see an emotional truth. I too was attempting to simplify life, perhaps as a way to cope with the unstructured vastness of emotion. Logic was my anchor, so I didn’t let go.

Fiction has given me a home at sea, and slowly my anchor is lifting. Life became an adventure in believing that how things feel can be just as interesting and insightful as any objective truth. I’ve come to appreciate that metaphors in fiction are rarely just a puzzle to be solved, a display of prowess, or a test of the reader’s intelligence. Often they are simply the only way to invoke a feeling more visceral and precise than stating it clearly ever could.

*“Metaphors are a great language tool, because they explain the unknowns in terms of the known” (Lamott 77).*

### A side effect of curiosity
I’ve always been curious, or as others have called me, a deep thinker. Thinking itself brings me joy, and fuels my desire to live and experience the world. But it was always a tool without an application. So I made every situation, decision, and relationship the nail to my hammer. I tried to “solve” or understand every detail. And when I’d “figured it out” I’d go over it again. I wasn’t doing it for the result, but the experience of swimming in nuance, and feeling an abstract sense of clarity that came from “accepting the universe the way it was.” A habit formed—bordering on obsession—and during especially stressful times in my life, it became a not-so-healthy coping mechanism. My curiosity ran rampant like a disease, leading me to see my life more like a series of problems to solve and truths to be discovered. I very rarely appreciated experiences for what they were, or remembered what they felt like without the reasoning I’d assigned to them.

I wish I knew at the time that writing would give me that same feeling of joy, and fulfill that need I didn’t know I had. And of course, it didn’t come with the detrimental side effects, which is pretty great. It turns out curiosity is so much of what writing is about. After my initial inspiration—often a situation and a feeling—it’s more about uncovering a world I can feel but don’t yet have the words to describe.

Writing has been extremely rewarding in itself, but what I’m most thankful for is the space it gives my mind to run free in made up worlds composed from my most passionate beliefs. So by the time I step back into the real world, all I want to do is be present and experience it as it is.

### What it means to be an artist
Why can art have a life changing effect on one person, and no impact on another?
I’ve heard a few artists say, in one way or another, that to appreciate art you must interpret it with generosity. I like that idea, and it makes sense to me. Art is not “real” in the way life is. It is a dedicated pursuit of emotional truths, even when it comes at the expense of objective ones.

*“A writer paradoxically seeks the truth and tells lies every step of the way” (Lamott 52).*

Understanding art requires a willingness to see your own emotional truths reflected in it. Of course this generosity may be automatic if you have the relevant life experiences, but I don’t think that’s necessarily required. If art is an expression of emotional truth, then compassion for it, as you would have for a fellow human expressing emotion, should be enough.

My mind was chewing on that idea one day while admiring the forest around me in the way I hadn’t before, finding meaning and story wherever I looked. Then it occurred to me. If art demands a generous interpretation, then being an artist is to interpret life with that same generosity.

It’s something I try to remind myself of now. And when I succeed to believe it, life becomes more vivid and I am more aware of how I feel. Unfortunate events don’t become less unfortunate, but they do become far more interesting and less overwhelming. Some of my best ideas come when I step back from a notable experience or repetitive thought and look at it generously; without the overwhelming urgency or inflated significance that so often blinds us.

It felt almost artificial to me at first, to intentionally find meaning where I believed none inherently existed. Though as it’s come to feel more natural, I’ve discovered something through that practice that I wasn’t expecting. I found pieces of myself, of real truth; things I had believed but never expressed; insights I may not have otherwise had.

But for all my realizations and the ways writing changed me, I still couldn’t tell you what I needed back then. I don’t know what, if anything, could have kicked my paralyzing writers block. Even Lamott’s book, as impactful as it was, probably wouldn’t have had the same effect if I had read it in high school—turns out even non-fiction requires generous interpretation.

The moment I finished the book, I called Wyatt. “I think I want to be a writer.” I saw the light at the end of my life-long battle with self expression. There was an entire world I’d been neglecting; years I had wasted, ignoring something I now deeply cherish.

Wyatt said on the phone that day, “being a writer means I always have something to do. Stuck in traffic? Pick a random car and make up a story about it.” For months, every time I walked outside I was flooded with ideas. I saw a coyote in the park—that could be something; I heard a tree creaking like it was struggling to stand—there’s a story; an apartment with a purple door, peeking out from the branches that hung like bangs across it’s face—that’s definitely a story.

I was inspired.

But inspiration wasn’t enough. And soon the quantity of ideas became paralyzing. Where do I start? Which one’s the best?

I typed them up into indigestible lists; revisited them, refined them; categorized them into characters, interactions, settings. Anything to make them more consumable. But it wasn’t enough. It would never be sustainable.
Inspiration is not a finite resource, as I’ve learned. It’s constantly replenished, like oxygen from trees. Maybe it’s no coincidence that inspiration has another meaning: “the drawing in of breath; inhalation.” Just as our lungs can’t inhale forever without suffocation, our brains too must at some point stop consuming and start to give back.

I get home from a walk and sit at my desk, ready to give writing another chance. I recall Lamott’s wisdom.

*“Writing is about hypnotizing yourself into believing in yourself, getting some work done, then unhypnotizing yourself and going over the material coldly” (Lamott 114).*

Then to remind myself of something my pursuit of logic refused to admit.

*“All you can give us is what life is about from your point of view” (Lamott 55).*

Her words bring a wave of calm over me, as if what they were really saying was “whatever happens, it’s okay.” I rest my fingers on the keys and repeat to myself the words of Lamott’s father, to a son overwhelmed by a report on birds due the next day—which he hadn’t yet started.

*“Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird” (19).*

I draw a deep breath, savor the moment, and finally begin a slow exhale.
