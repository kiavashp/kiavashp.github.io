The clouds were orange
and the sky was red
Charley was asleep
in the bunkbed

the window rattled
the cabin swayed
his head turned to face
out of the train

he woke and asked
<i>Mommy, where are we?</i>
<i>Is this Mars?</i>
he said

<i>No Honey</i>,
I wanted to say
<i>This is the world
burning</i>

But I smiled
and nodded instead
