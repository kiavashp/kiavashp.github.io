When I'm with you, you're in my world
One you’ve become familiar

In this place, you are the guest
And I the humble guide

This is my most natural state
The world how I see and breathe it

A shelter from the outer storms
That blow outside the window

But if one day, the world’s we live
Collide amongst the ether

I'll change my mind, and then it shall
Be ours, or better, neither
