The cafeteria was nicer than I expected. Like the one at my high school, and with a similar vibe too. There was a hint of freedom in the air, despite our lack of control. Freedom from what, I'm not sure; the solitary rooms maybe or the expectations of others that saturated the world outside. I saw in their faces, if not in mine, a certain rebellion, birthed from lack of responsibility and control. Very teenage-like indeed.

I'd been in my room for no more than fifteen minutes when the dinner bell rang. Just enough time to settle in, and start to process what I had just agreed to.

I walked through the propped open double doors with a watcher stationed on each side. I got a few looks as I made my way between the tables; nothing hostile, just curiosity mostly, and a certain vague indifference. Everybody looked approachable enough, as far as strangers go. Most sat in small groups of two or three, some alone, but as if expecting another. There was only one man—in the back corner where the line for food started, and another watcher stood—who resembled the portrayal of psychiatric patients in movies from a century ago. Unkempt hair, a curled and compressed posture, and a general unsettling aura about him; this was clear, even from a glance across the large echoing room.

The smell of food wafted past my nose as I approached. Carrying the power of warmth, like a gentle embrace. I took my place in line, glanced back at the man rocking back and forth in his seat, grabbed a tray and plate from the counter, and made my way down the impressive spread of rice and beans, soups and breads, salads, sautéed vegetables, sauces and dressings, and finally dessert. It was when I made it to the loaves of freshly baked bread—sourdough, wheat, rye, you name it—when I heard a loud voice behind me. It was the man in the corner, yelling nonsense I could hardly understand, with such conviction that he apparently thought pounding the table was necessary to make his point. His watcher looked on as you would to a dog barking behind a chain linked fence.

"It makes more sense why some of us are here than others." A voice behind me said.

I looked around and saw a man I thought to be around my age, with dark hair and kind eyes.

"I'm Izel." He said.

My diaphragm flexed suddenly, suggesting a laugh, then I cleared my throat. "Julian. Nice to meet you." I said, still surprised I'd been acknowledged at all.

"So, where were you when you heard the ring?" He asked me, without pause.

I was taken back by his directness, though the question seemed reasonable enough. I thought back to the incident outside the subway. The one I remember imagining, but never experiencing. I'd spent the last half an hour deciding whether or not that was real, and still didn't have an answer. But if that wasn't it, then I don't know what was, I thought.

"The memory is fuzzy, but I must have been on my way to work. Though I can't be sure."

Izel smiled, as if silently laughing to himself. I must have looked flustered or confused.

"Weird as hell right?" He said. "I'd never been aware of such a big blindspot in my memory before. But don't worry, it'll probably come back eventually." He paused, and grabbed a slice of rye. "Well, on second thought, maybe you don't want to remember." He said, and erupts in laughter.

When we reached the end of the counter he invited me to sit with him and the others.

There are two open spots at the end of the table. Izel slips into one, and I stand at the end for a moment.

"Look who I found." He said to the table. "This is Julian. He was on his way to work."

A man with a scar across his brow chuckled. "Ha! Just like you Iz."

The rest let out a sympathetic sigh.

"Sit down, don't be shy." Said the man with the scar. "I'm Jamae. Heard it after waking from a nightmare. Like in the fucking movies, if you can believe it."

They continued around the table, introducing themselves.

"I am named Vahid. It was after my wife's death." Said a man with a thick beard. "We welcome you."

"Evrin. I'm new too. Don't remember yet."

I set my tray down on the corner of the table, and took the open seat.

Izel looked at me and smiled. "So! Tell us about you. If you want to, of course."

"Yeah! What kind of work sent you ringing your way to crazy town?" Jamae said. "Not construction, like this fingerless fool, I hope."

Izel rolled his eyes. I looked over and notices his left hand was missing two fingers, pinky and ring.

"I was a journalist. Focusing on tech, actually."

"Oh good. So you can tell us what's going on here?" Vahid asked, with hope in his eyes.

"Not quite. But I'm currently working on an article about Emotech. This place specifically, funny enough. Which makes this all feel a bit surreal."

Vahid drops his head and returns to eating in silence.  A couple of the others inhale sharply, like they touched a hot stove.

"Yeah. An unfortunate coincidence. But maybe this will be good, in the end. More material to draw from, once I get out."

Silence lingers. A couple of them swap glances. Izel nods and carries a fork to his mouth with his three fingered hand.

Evrin, who looks like the youngest in the group, is the only one still watching me intently. "Do you think we'll get out soon?"

"Oh sure. Can't be more than a few weeks at most. They've been increasing—"

"What'd I tell you, kid." Jamae interrupts, looking at Ervin, who's maybe a couple years younger. "Get comfortable. Hope's only going to make it worse."

I looked around the table, expecting a response, or an objection, but got nothing. They just continued eating quietly, as if there was nothing more to say. I was hesitant to start again.

"No, they're so close! Really. They have to be. They are a good and honest company, and there are even rumors that they are expanding their research operations to account for the steady rise in new cases. That's what initially got me so interested in the topic actually. Oh man, you should see the kind of equipment they have back there. Synthetic brains capable of simulating different environmental stimuli. Computer models, these things that grow real neural circuits. It's wild. And—"

I'd lost most of them by then, though I didn't know it at the time. This happens to me more and more now; the endless rambling, points that lead nowhere, the blind distracted passion. Their expressions seemed to suggest I was simply desperate for attention.

"Yeah, that's what we've been hearing since we got here." Jamae finally said.

"Wait, how long have you all been here?"

There was a moment of silence while they all waited for someone else to go first.

"Two years and four months for me." Said Vahid.

"Next week will be three years for Izzy."

"Holy shit!" I said, turning to Izel, at a loss for words. "Haven't they found even a temporary fix for the implant yet?"

After a long silence, Izel spoke. "I don't think it's the implant that needs fixing."

<span class="words-section-break"></span>

"An unfortunate coincidence." Is that really why I'm here? Now that I'd said it out loud, I wasn't so confident I believed it.

I have trouble now, telling the difference between self awareness and self doubt; truth and delusion. I haven't been able to decide whether that piercing ring that changed my life was an interruption or an awakening. All I know is that it would come to redefine everything I knew. My strengths now seemed like my weaknesses; and my weakness, like my greatest strength. Though that hadn't yet occurred to me, as I lay in that bed, watching the last rays of daylight pass increasingly horizontal through the high window.

I was taking it all in, while I could. I wouldn't be here for long, I thought. I must try to remember every detail, and how it felt. The satin finish on the beds bamboo frame; the dense foam that padded the floors and walls; the inexplicably soft sheets. And the door, that wouldn't close the last half of the way; not until the halls had cleared, and the building went quiet. Just before the lights dimmed, the latch on the ceiling would retract, and the door—that gentle beast—would crawl back to its frame and lock itself in place until the breakfast bell rang.

I had sympathy, even then, for my new hopeless friends. I couldn't imagine being there, away from my family, for that long. Three years? Tabitha would be twelve by then. And Charlie would be out of the womb longer than Vahid had been stuck in that place.

I was determined to find a way to get them out. There must be some kind of progress that's been made since the first case, six years ago. Maybe there's something the scientists are overlooking. Maybe they are too close to the problem. I didn't exactly feel like the best person for the job, but I had to do something. I wish I could talk to Janet and get her thoughts.

Oh shit!

I roll out of bed and hit the large button on the wall. Within thirty seconds the heavy door clicks open, the lights raise, and a nurse walks in.

He scans the room, and whispers. "Good evening. How can I help—"

"My wife! My child! I need my phone—I need to call them! They need to know where I am."

"Don't worry Mr. Reese." He said in an urgently calming voice. "Your family was notified this morning upon your arrival. Now get some sleep, you have a busy day tomorrow."

"But my phone. How will they contact me?"

"They have our number. And we have theirs. Devices are not allowed in the facility, as I hope you will understand, for security and health reasons. But I assure you, when they call, we will let you know. And if you'd like to talk to them, we'll happily schedule a time for your family to visit."

"Do you have my phone though?"

"I will check now and let you know in the morning."

With a reassuring expression, he slowly stepped back into the hall. The lights faded back down to their warm gentle glow, and the door returned to its resting place. I looked up at the window, for the light that was no longer there.

No phones, I thought. And I need to schedule time to see them? It made sense I suppose. I was just glad I wouldn't have to do it for long. Especially with Janet having to take care of Tabitha, and while she's pregnant no less, all on her own.

There are things I want to say, feelings I want to remember. I reach to the ground for my—. Shit! My briefcase!

I smash the button again, and the nurse returns, less urgently this time.

"What is it, Mr. Reese?"

"My briefcase! What about my briefcase? I might have dropped it."

"I'm not aware of any briefcase, but I will check for that too." He paused. "I know the first night can be challenging, but I assure you everything will be okay. That being said, if you have any further troubles with worry or restlessness, we can give you something that will help."

He stopped for a moment, waiting for me to dismiss him.

"Is there anything else I can do for you tonight Mr. Reese?"

"Yeah. Do you have a notepad? And a pen, or pencil? I need to write some stuff down."

"There's a recorder in the top drawer of the bedside table. You may use that as you please. All the recordings will be private between you and your assigned therapist," He looked down at his tablet, "Mrs. Morgan, who you'll meet tomorrow. She's one of our absolute finest."

I reached over and opened the drawer, and picked up the recorder.

"Goodnight Mr. Reese."

<span class="words-section-break"></span>

The breakfast bell wasn't so much a bell as it was a gong. Starting soft, barely audible, and getting louder with each strike. By the second or third strike, birds started chirping, softly and sporadically at first, as if being woken. At first I thought they were real birds I was hearing from outside. I never could tell for sure, and the patterns seemed different every day, but now I think it might have been part of the bell.

That first morning though, I didn't hear the bell at all. I must have slept through it. I didn't know what time it was, or how late I stayed up the previous night, recording all my thoughts. There was no clock in the room.

I was woken by the nurse, who looked more than a little groggy himself. He brought me to another wing of the building, close to the one I was initially interviewed in. On the way he grabbed me a breakfast bar and I scarfed it down.

A different psychologist was waiting there, reading over something—presumably my record—like someone would skim through a magazine they've already read. This room was bigger than the last, and medical equipment lined the walls. I was run through multiple brain scans, cognitive assessments, tests of my motor functions, and more interviews.

They asked me every question under the sun. Starting with repeating the questions from my admittance exam, then hypotheticals about the past and the future, and what a successful rehabilitation would mean to me. A lot of the things my mind pondered that previous night. And though my doubt in the process fluctuated throughout, overall I felt like it went well.

"Very good Mr. Reese."

"Excellent work Julian."

"That's a very healthy way of looking at things." She would say with a satisfied look on her face.

Lunch was brought in for me. I sat under a machine while I ate. It was like a hair dryer in those old salons I'd seen pictures of. The bulky chairs or couches with the cheese grater looking glass dome that went over your head. Though this one probably dealt in brain waves instead of hot air.

I wonder if it could tell what food I was eating, or how much I was or wasn't enjoying it. There was this study, first done a few decades ago, where they guessed what the person was thinking or dreaming about, just by recording their brainwaves. It involved a learning algorithm and hours of training; showing the participant images, and capturing their brains response. It wasn't perfect, but it showed it was possible, and there have been many studies since replicating their work. They're surprisingly good now, these algorithms; stringing together multiple neural networks for conceptual representations, and feeding that into an image generator, which itself was trained with an adversarial network meant to distinguish the generated images from real ones. The results were these crazy movie-like, near realistic images with rough movements, representing most if not all of the participants' conscious thoughts. But there's only so far they've been able to take it. The technology isn't viable outside of a well controlled lab yet—though there has been a widespread consumer desire for it. Imagine everything we could do with something like that. I could have used it last night, instead of speaking into that device. It would have gotten so much more nuance and depth, and probably wouldn't have taken me all night either.

We finished right before dinner, and with no time to do anything else useful, I went straight to the cafeteria.

It was quiet. The lids still covered the food trays; leaking steam from the hot water that churned below them. A watcher was in the corner again, with the same man from yesterday, who was quieter now, eating his food with his head ducked down and back curled, like he was cowering from the world.

I kept my distance, starting at the second set of trays, and reaching back to grab a plate, as if being within a certain radius would cause him to lash out at me. I'm not proud of how I acted, but it was only partially out of fear. I also just wanted to respect his privacy; it was bad enough that he had a personal watcher hovering over him, looking still and calculated as he ate.

The main course was fried rice. The staff was quick with the covers, returning them just after dishing food onto my plate.

I grabbed my filled tray and looked around at the empty tables. I couldn't remember which one they sat at. Do they always sit at the same one? I strained to remember, but ultimately I was too famished. I took a seat at the closest one, and started devouring my plate. At every sound I looked up to see if it was them.

The group started trickling in after the dinner bell finally rang. I was picking at the last bites on my plate, topping off my stomach. They sat down one by one around me at the table, giving a quick hello to the others, and starting on their meals. Conversation didn't develop to any more than that, until Izel joined us with some news.

"My wife's coming to visit, a week from Sunday."

The others lit up, dropping their utensils.

Jamae: "That's great, man."

Vahid: "Wonderful news."

Izel: "Yeah. I'm really looking forward to it. I can't wait."

Jamae: "It's been too long."

Vahid: "And how is your son?"

Izel: "Good. He's apparently doing better now. It's been almost three weeks since his last episode."

Vahid: "Very good."

Jamae: "Tell him to stay strong. Can't let yourself slip up again."

Izel: "Thanks."

Me: "Congratulations. What kind of episodes was he having?"

Their initial excitement was fading, but their faces were still bright. You'd think this was the most exciting thing to happen to them all week.

Izel: "The doctors weren't sure what it was at first, exactly. Some sort of panic attack, or maybe something having to do with a shift in or loss of consciousness—it tended to happen most often later in the evenings. Now doctors are thinking he is just having a heightened reaction to his transition from adolescence to his teenage years."

Me: "Yeah, that makes sense. Those are always tough years. Something similar happened to my wife when she was younger. Although she was living on a farm back then, which made her transition, let's say, a little more dramatic."

Vahid: "Yeah, I can imagine. That was tough work."

Me: "And slaughtering animals is not for the faint of heart. Does your son have the implant?"

Izel: "Yeah. Since birth, just like his old man."

They returned to their meals, and I did too, taking another small bite.

"Hey," I said, looking around the group to make sure I wasn't interrupting anyone else, "I was wondering, after our conversation yesterday: do you personally know anyone who's been rehabilitated?"

They all nodded quietly.

"A few have gotten close, but it never lasted for long." Izel said.

Vahid continued. "But you might still have a chance, Julian. I believe the longer you stay here, the further you must climb to get out."

Jamae chimed in. "Yeah, and don't listen when they try to ease your transition or whatever bullshit they call it. That'll just make you complacent. You have to fight while your mind is still swinging at full force."

I looked around the table. There weren't any strong objections, which still surprised me.

After a moment of collective silence, Evrin said. "Well I hope they figure out what's wrong soon." He paused, nervously, and looked across the room. "Before we all end up like Neo."

I turned behind me and saw the man playing with the last of his food, and mumbling to himself now. The watcher stood silently, his patience waning, as if looking at a faulty watch.

"That's Neo?" I exclaimed.

I had heard about him—everyone had. The first man ever reported to hear the ring, six years ago. His was the first serious case, and the driving force behind the transformation of this very facility two years later, into a treatment center it is today. There had been sparse rumors circling for years since of the implants adverse effects. Some claimed increased headaches, and other warned of societal collapse, or that it was making us into machines. But it wasn't until Neo's story hit headlines that Emotech and the medical community at large had reason to take any of it seriously.

"I thought he was released, and rehabilitated! What, a year or two ago? Was I just hallucinating?"

Vahid: "Yes. This is true. I had been here six months then. I remember that as a day of great hope."

Me: "So then what happened?"

Izel shifted in his seat. "He couldn't handle it."

Jamae: "Yeah, poor fucker only lasted thirty-four hours. The ring just kept kicking his ass, over and over. Blacked out, every time."

Vahid: "Twenty-one times, to be exact."

Izel: "Or so we've heard."

Jamae: "Man, you never believe anything! What, do you know something we don't?"

Izel: "No, not necessarily. I'm just saying, we can't really know anything for sure, especially from in here."

Jamae looked irritated.

Izel: "Anyway, they tried removing his implant after that, which bought him another two and a half days in the real world."

Jamae: "Yeah, couldn't handle that shit either though."

Vahid: "And, if we can believe the stories, it was supposedly even worse than when he had the implant."

Izel: "That part I definitely don't believe."

Me: "Well yeah, because he lasted longer, right?"

Jamae: "It's not like he had a choice."

Me: "How do you mean?"

Jamae: "He's their guinea pig. We all are. They got us by the balls, man."

Vahid: "Oh come on Jamae. You're always making things so dramatic."

Jamae: "It's true! Did you even read the contract?"

Vahid: "Yes, I did Jamae. If you think it was so bad, then why did you sign it?"

Izel: "Anyway! As the story goes, it was more of a subtle growing pain, versus the chaotic ups and downs of the implant."

Jamae: "I'd take that over constantly being miserable any day. At least there were moments when he felt normal!"

Izel: "I'm not sure there were."

Evrin: "I heard that he still heard the ring even without the implant. Is that true?"

Izel: "No. Well, maybe, but it doesn't seem like it was the same. He didn't black out those times. So I'm guessing it was more like a traumatic memory coming back to haunt him. Like he was imagining it a bit."

Me: "Oh yeah. I think I experienced something like that, when I woke up here yesterday."

Izel: "Yeah, apparently that's common too."

Jamae: "Especially with all those drugs they pump you with after the extraction."

Izel: "Have you heard anything like it since?"

Me: "No. I don't think so. Well, maybe a little, in a dream last night. But I don't remember exactly."

Vahid: "That's very good news."

Jamae: "No it ain't! Just means your mind's getting soft! You gotta keep fighting man. That shit isn't normal. None of this is."

Izel: "Jamae might have a point."

Jamae: "Fuck yeah I do!"

Izel: "Even if he's taking it a little too far."

Vahid: "As usual."

Jamae rolled his eyes.

Izel: "You never know how much of it is mental. Rehabilitation could be more about recovering your mindset, you know?"

Me: "Yeah, totally. Thanks. I'll keep that in mind."

Izel: "That's just speculation though. Most of this is."

Me: "Why? Because you don't trust Neo's story?"

Vahid: "None of us have heard the story from him directly."

I was puzzled, which they must have picked up on.

Jamae: "Well just look at the fucking guy! Not exactly the most approachable dude in the world."

My guest tensed from guilt over my behavior earlier, which I decided to keep to myself.

Me: "So what happened to him after his second release?"

Izel: "He got brought back here immediately—or so we heard. But we didn't see him until weeks later."

Me: "And he hasn't left since?"

Vahid: "Would you want to take your chances after what he's been through?"

Me: "I'd hope so."

Jamae: "It doesn't matter. He's probably not allowed to leave anymore. They got him locked up in one of those 'self-reflection rooms' now. It's a miracle they even let him out for lunch."

Me: "Have any of you tried getting out of here?" I mumbled.

Silence fell over the group and immediately I was embarrassed, surprised by my own boldness. I wanted to take it back.

Vahid: "My therapist says I'm not ready yet, but I'm getting closer."

Jamae: "Bro, that's just code for 'you're broken beyond repair.' Everyone knows that."

Vahid: "You know Jamae, maybe if you weren't so negative you'd actually have a chance of leaving some day too!"

Izel: "It's definitely a risk. That much we know is true. There's always a chance it could make it all worse, and it's impossible to say how likely that is. I think that's the biggest reason why none of us have tried—or at least why I haven't. I want to make sure I'm actually ready, that I'm not rushing it."

A quiet understanding hung between us.

Me: "So Neo's really the only one who's ever left?"

Vahid: "I don't think anyone else has tried."

<span class="words-section-break"></span>

I was walking back from the cafeteria one day when I found it. I had taken a different route this time—you know, to spice things up a bit. The door was ajar, and a light was on inside. I couldn't tell if I was allowed in or not, but there was no sign saying otherwise. I had just spent the last few days thinking about all the work I could be doing on my article; all the new questions I had, and things I could expand on. So I guess the question of whether I should or not didn't cross my mind before I found myself inside.

The walls were plastered with headlines, most of which I'd seen in the papers over the years. It was like a shrine to social progress. What Jamae might have said was built on the graves of those it failed. Or was it us who failed it? The jury was still out.

"2033 Marks Record High For Crime — Experts Blame Polarization and Degrading Emotional Stability"

"Shifting Tides — New Startup Makes Big Promises for Social Change."

"New emotions, new you?"

"They said money can't buy happiness. With Emotech, now it can."

"Emotech shown to improve standard of living by 5x in JUST 3 years."

"First 'Healthy Minds' clinic opens next month. Promises free Emotech implants to underprivileged communities."

"GPD hits all time high in USA."

"Emotech struggles to meet growing demand."

"FDA approves Emotech as treatment for clinical depression."

"World Health Organization helps take Emotech global."

"Still haven't gotten your implant? Get it now and it'll be the last thing you ever procrastinate on!"

It reestablished my enthusiasm, to say the least. Even if I did notice a lack of coverage of their missteps and growing pains; the widespread fear of mind control, the protests over price and equitable availability, the instability it caused in earlier versions of its development (before clinical trials). And, of course, there was nothing about Neo. But it made sense to me why that was. It was probably for the best, I thought. Like Izel said, half the battle might be about your mindset. And especially if you're not scientifically minded, or all that educated on the topic, it can be hard to interpret these things with a healthy amount of objectivity.

I scoured the shelves of books, trying to find anything I could on the clinical trials, reported side effects, and treatments. I figured there must be some sign of this happening before, right? But I couldn't find any proof at the time. And the patterns I had noticed in the cafeteria only increased my confusion. Everyone seemed around the same age, my age, give or take ten years or so. And most of them—as you've probably noticed—were male. What could be causing this discrepancy in gender? Or was it a difference in how the cases expressed themselves, or who was offered rehabilitation here, and who accepted? It could have been so many things, but it still seemed strange.

I knew there was a heightened risk of malfunction in females. But it was minor, and only statistically significant in groups where the implant was introduced or removed during puberty or pregnancy. But either way, if anything there should be more females here than male, all other things being equal, right?

I was reading about a study done on Scavengers when a nurse walked in—by the way, I never found out if they were medical nurses or not, but that's what we all called them.

She told me I needed rest. I told her I felt fine, but she didn't seem convinced.

"Rest is an important part of the recovery process, especially during these early days."

I looked her over, waiting to hear more, but she had no more to say. Fine, I thought, and followed her out of the library.

"Are you feeling okay Mr. Reese? Why didn't you go back to your room after lunch?"

I mumbled through a few false starts. "I was going to—"

"Did you lose your way? That could be a sign of a more serious problem."

"No. No. I just. I was curious what that room was."

"Well now, that's interesting isn't it? Did it feel like an impulse you couldn't control?"

"What? No. Well. Yeah, no. It was just curiosity. Yeah, curiosity."

She just kept walking.

"Sorry. Why do you ask? Is the library not for patients?"

We got to my room, and I stepped inside. She stood in the doorway for a moment, waiting for me to sit down, then told me to wait for her, that she'd be right back.

She came in rolling a cart with one of those hair dryer looking things mounted to the top. We came to call them brain dryers—a joke Jamae made one day, after their resemblance, of course, and the warming tingling feeling it sent through your scalp.

She must have read the confusion and concern on my face.

"There's nothing to worry about. I just want to check a few things, that's all."

She rolled the cart to the edge of my bed, extended the arm with the dome on the end, and positioned it over my head. She clicked a button on the side and looked down at her tablet. This time it beeped. She took a breath that inflated her chest, and relaxed her face on exhale.

She asked me again if I was feeling okay, or if I felt a heightened tendency to lash out. I told her no, and asked why.

"You seem to be struggling with something serious. And I am concerned it will only get worse."

Apparently I measured over some threshold for mental pain that day. But as far as I can remember it didn't feel like anything abnormal. That is, no worse than the last week had been. Maybe even a little better. I was beginning to get used to the idea of being stuck here for a little while. It wasn't all that bad. I had food, shelter, and a few friends—one at least. I missed Janet of course, and Tabitha. But I'd see them soon enough, I was confident in that.

She offered me a shot, given weekly, to "reduce emotional instability and risk of outbursts."

Outbursts? Was I really at risk for that? I asked myself.

"You may be struggling with your transition here. We understand, it's not something you're used to yet. This may help get you back on track, towards rehabilitation."

And that's more or less how things went anytime I tried to find something to do other than resting and eating. I tried to be okay with it, but it started to wear me down. It's not something I was ever used to, this prolonged building irritation.

I told her no thank you. That I felt fine, and would tell her if anything changed. I could feel myself trying to come across stable, which only further fueled the doubt I had in myself. Maybe that's what the machine was picking up on: my self doubt. But that thought only continued the spiral of feeling that I wasn't okay, and then doubting my ability to assess my well being at all.

Anyway, I won't drag you through all the days that followed, which seemed to just slip by, skipping straight into memory without my ever experiencing them.

I was able to contact my boss, and the firm agreed to delay my article for a few weeks, but I can't expect them to wait forever. I left Janet a message too, just so she could hear my voice, in case it helped in some way. I don't know, maybe it made things worse. But it helped me, I think.

I was worried about the pay I would be unable to earn too. The UBI payments should be enough to cover her and Tabitha's expenses, but with the baby on the way, we were hoping to have a little extra buffer, just in case. And the longer I'm in here, the smaller that gap becomes. Maybe I was getting a little ahead of myself though.

At random moments, like when going from wakefulness to sleep, I had crippling realizations I didn't know whether to trust. Like the more erratic I got, the more distant the nurses seemed. Or realizing how often I'd find myself rambling while answering their questions, and then other times, being unusually quiet. I felt like I was getting a glimpse into what Neo's life must be like, and to tell you the truth, it scared the shit out of me.

I apparently got so bad that they thought it necessary to install a freaking brain dryer to the wall above my bed, then send a nurse in once a day to watch me sit under it. That's how they measured how much distress I was feeling or something, and the readings apparently weren't looking good. They tried giving me more time outside, but I didn't want that anymore. I even started taking my meals in bed.

It's so strange now, to describe all these things I felt; they so quickly went from feeling alien back then to feeling normal, and now, in hindsight, alien again. Almost unbelievable, like these memories were fabricated and placed in my mind.

I would spend hours ruminating on my previous life, and all the things I would be missing. Tabitha's next recital would be coming up soon; I tried to imagine her playing on stage, with a longing that felt more like mourning. I thought of Janet alone in our house, while Tabitha was at school, continuing to live our life, alone: tending to the garden, cleaning the house, raising one child while preparing to birth another, going through her ups and downs without anyone there to support her.

It was as if a new world had opened up to me. One that, as far as I knew, had been hiding in plain sight all along. A world of struggle, and longing, and shadows—everything seemed like a shadow now. And in the moments I felt all my emotional turbulences were irrational, my awareness of them only deepened the pain. I was hopelessly broken by the hands of something I could not grasp, or seem to do anything about.

I was coming up on two weeks into my stay and things were only getting worse. I hadn't seen my friends from the cafeteria for a week, except occasionally when one of them would pass my door in the hall, and had time to wave hello. But my more frequent napping was making that rarer still.

I lived in a perpetually suppressed kind of consciousness. Everything blurred together into this undulating state somewhere between wakefulness and sleep, life and a bad dream. But that day I knew was a Sunday. I had just skipped the group therapy session, which only happened twice a week. I'd gone to the Wednesday one, which felt like work to me. And they were optional. So I decided I was going to "take the weekend off."

I was sitting in bed, looking up through the window at the bright sky. I watched the clouds pass quickly across my sliver of a view, giving their frosty unrefined lobes the illusion of shifting back and forth, growing and shrinking from the window frame.

I had been hearing activity down the hall, which was normal. Some patients struggled more than others, as Izel had said. Broken monologues often echoed outside my door, before being interrupted by a watcher—or a nurse, if they found themselves available—leading to a crescendo, then quickly fading, until it all ended with the heavy click of a door.

This one started much the same, apart from not sounding like any of the usual voices. They were rambling in a sorrowful tone, something about a marriage, and being stuck. It sounded like someone was having a bad first day. They went on for quite a while, without anyone attempting to intercept, that I could hear. Then their frustration turned to what sounded like blame, and they began pounding at the wire glass windows of the nurses station.

This is a first, I thought to myself. I tried not to focus on it thought. There was nothing I could do, and it didn't feel right to just listen to someone else's pain.

I turned back to the now cloudless sky, and tried to let my thoughts float by. Maybe unsurprisingly, it didn't work. The harder I tried to let go, the stronger the pull was that I felt to indulge in whatever was happening outside, and try to imagine what was happening.

I stepped out of my bed, and went to close the door—as much as I was allowed. They screamed, and curiosity brought my head around the corner. Down the hall, laying on the floor, with two watchers kneeled on his arms, was Izel.

"I just want to go back! I'm losing everything—" he wailed.

His body relaxed suddenly. One of the watchers held a device to his head. His eyes closed, then slowly crept back open, repeatedly. He craned his neck and found me in his sight. His eyes fluttered, and his mouth shook and spat nonsense murmurs.

I stood there in disbelief, for as long as I could bear, and rushed back into my room. I fell on my bed, and all of a sudden, this potential for outburst I was being told I had, appeared and released itself, like a dam had broken in my mind.

I didn't know what was happening to Izel, but as far as I was concerned I didn't have to. Something shifted in me, exposing a thought I wouldn't be able to escape. If it could happen to him, then it could happen to any of us.

For the moment before, a rush of thoughts flooded me. I felt I was drowning. And when the scream finally exploded out of my lungs, the drowning stopped, and the world seemed quieter. It was a special kind of silence, one that permitted sound, but had a peacefulness to it all the same.

My special silence only lasted for a short while, before being interrupted by a swarm of nurses who came in and sedated me too.

When I woke again, the sky was dark, and I wanted nothing more than to be alone. I didn't feel like myself. I didn't have control of my behavior, clearly. I could have been anyone, I could have done anything. I struggled to understand this new version of myself, and how it fit into the self that I knew. It came out of nowhere. It made no sense to me.

A nurse came in soon after, and if just as a formality, ran the brain dryer on me again. He didn't even look down at his tablet before continuing.

"I hope you will take more seriously now, the nature of your condition."

"What happened to Izel?" I blurted without thinking.

"Izel will be fine. I would be more concerned with myself if I were you. His episode was triggered by an acute event. But you, Mr. Reese, are in a state of constant degradation. If this continues we may be forced to recommend a change to your living situation, severely limiting the freedom you are now afforded."

The hall was quiet again. The brain dryer buzzed above my head.

"I will offer this again, and although you have full autonomy to make whatever decision you'd like, I heavily encourage you to accept."

I looked up at the latch on the ceiling, barely holding back the towering door. "What offer?"
"The shot, Mr. Reese."
