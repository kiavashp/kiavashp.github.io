From the darkest depths of my unconscious, I slowly began to rise. Liked a bubble too large to surface without wobbling sporadically from side to side. I still remember it like a dream I've had a hundred times. Each moment unfolding in saturated frames.

The fluorescent lights penetrate my eyes one ray at a time, painting a vibrant canvas that blurred across my retina, like a camera struggling to keep focus. (How strange it feels to relate to the world through our creations.)

I was consumed by the moment, with no memory of before. This is what birth must feel like, I thought to myself.

I've come off of anesthetics before, but this felt different. Everything was so pleasant. Almost serene. Where am I? I asked myself, and as if the world was listening, it showed me an answer.

A waterfall fed a pristine mountain stream, trickling down well worn rocks. There were birds singing and diving in leisurely play. Frogs jumped around on the muddy banks. The falling water slapped against the stones as it swayed in a gentle breeze, sounding like waves crashing on a coastal cliff.

How did I get here? I didn't remember going outside. No, I'm not here. I can't be. But all my senses were telling me I was. The last thing I recalled was that memory. The city. I ran my hand through the flowing water and watched my fingers dance in the stream, but my arm felt stiff, locked in place. And my eyes told me more of what I knew couldn't be true. The cool water tickling my palms. The crisp air brushing against my face. I knew this place, long ago, while exploring as a child in the mountains. But I hadn't been there in years—a decade at least.

As quickly as the world had manifested itself around me, so too did it disappear by the weight of my unquenchable doubt. My arm was the first to go, vanishing from the stream. My body went limp, and the delicate undulating flow quickly consumed my view. I plunged through the surface and back into darkness. My hearing muffled and those pleasant sounds started to fade. The world returned in smudges of light that warped and shifted as their edges refined. A low hum pushed through my sensory haze like mountains through the crust of the earth.

I could make out some of my surroundings now. The white coats floating across the room, and a sign on the wall that said "Intake." There were two bumps ahead of me under a thin white blanket. In my daze, I imagined them moving, and was surprised when they did. Feet! I had a body, a psychical form, which for some reason I found surprising. I flexed my arm to raise my hand, but something held my wrist back.

I wriggled my head across the clouds beneath my head, and stretched my stiff neck to peek over them. A large machine of metal and plastic, stood a few feet tall on the floor beside me, with tubes and what looked like a coat hanger mounted on top.

The swelling hums, like echoes of crashing water, shortened and sharpened to a rhythmic beep that pulsed with every flash of the dot that snaked across the screen.

The mountains had faded from my consciousness completely by now, and the beep got louder. Each pulse stretched further across time until it blurred with the others into a constant ring, as if reverberating in the chamber of my skull. It was debilitating, but distant, in a way that was strangely familiar.

A memory—or was it another hallucination, I thought—materialized in my mind; slowly at first, then all at once.

Horns blaring, people talking, the sound of tired on pavement. And the smell. That subtle, ever present smell of trash and animal waste that's been baked for decades between skyscrapers and a seasonal sun. I was headed somewhere, the office maybe. The air was thick but cool. The light shined horizontally between the towering walls of glass and steel. I'm walking past the subway steps, thinking about the research I had planned—some article I was working on—the subject, I failed to recall. An older woman is struggling down there, and begins to scream. I turn and catch a shadow scurrying up the subway stairs and onto the street. Their face is covered. Their clothes, ripped and soiled. I recognize the figure, something about the way they move. A rage builds up inside me, burning through my chest. I drop my briefcase, and throw my legs into a full out sprint. I follow as they weave their way through the crowd. My vision fills with blurred figures passing on both sides. Then everything goes black, and the ringing returns.

Beyond the piercing ring, I hear a voice, distant and muffled. "Sir? Sir! I need you to answer me. How are you feeling? Are you in any pain?"

The ringing slowly subsides, and I struggle in my daze to mumble a few words. "Fine. Fine. Just, confused." I try to say, but my mouth falls limp.

"Confused? That's perfectly normal. It should wear off soon enough." She says as she taps at the screen beside me and disconnects the tubes from my arm.

"Are you ready, Mr.—" She lifts a tablet to her face. "—Reese?"

I want to ask for what—and a hundred other questions—but can't find the words before she disappears behind me, and carts me off down the hall.

The room was empty before she rolled me in, except for a chair, and a camera mounted in the corner of the ceiling—which I didn't notice. She rolled me to the center of the room, placed a pile of clothes at the foot of the bed, and began to unbuckle the restraints that held down my limbs. The clothes looked familiar. They must be mine. Of course they're mine, I realize. I try to call back that daydream to check what I was wearing, with no success. When I look up, she's leaving.

"Wait!" I hollered. "Where am I?"

"Someone will be with you soon. They will answer all your questions." She smiled and turned away, letting the door click shut behind her.

Silence returned, which felt nice for a moment, until it started filling with noise. That inaudible kind of noise that your mind produces when there's nothing else to hear. Maybe it's the sound of your brain working too hard to listen, or just trying to make sense of your mental pain.

I swing my leg out of the sheets and place it on the ground. Sparks run through my toes and shoot in tingles up my leg. My foot feels warm pressed against the firm floor. I adjust my hands to keep my balance, and swing out my right leg too. It must have been hours since I was last standing.

I walk my hands down the mattress, making my way to the foot of the bed. I untie my gown, and pinch it around my waist. Grabbing the shirt, I pull it over me with my free hand and wiggle my head around to find the hole for my neck. I feel it get stuck on something. I press my hips against the bed to hold the gown in place, and pull my shirt with both hands. My finger catches on a flap of gauze behind my ear. It stings, then burns, like a fresh wound. I stretch my shirt carefully away from it; my balance waivers as I pull it down over my eyes. Once around my neck, I reach behind my ear again and gently feel around the gauze, to see if it's still there, underneath. I can't tell, and it hurts too much to check.

I grab the pair of jeans and slip one leg in, then stumble and shoot an arm out to catch myself against the wall. The faint sound of a motor grinds for a second, then stops as I catch my breath. I look around, but nothing looks to have moved.

Once clothed I sit on the edge of the mattress and wait. Time passes unbearably slowly, and with a sense of urgency that's unsettling. In the small, empty, quiet room, I felt overwhelmed, panicked, as if fighting for my life. I'd never felt something so intense and uncontrollable, especially in such a mundane environment. Maybe I just really have to pee, I thought.

I shifted my weight onto my legs and waddled towards the door, then stumbled and fell as I reached for the handle. As I struggle to stand, a siren rings, washing away all other sound. It's deafening, and sends me into a frenzy. And from that impossibly loud whining, another sound emerges and fills my skull—it's the ringing again. I collapse uncontrollably to the ground, and the world returns to darkness.

When I wake I'm still in that room, back in the bed, in my same clothes. I was hoping this was all a nightmare, though I'm not sure that would be any better, or make any more sense. I suppose waking in the same place I passed out was the next best thing. Nurses hovered around me, all looking terribly concerned.

One of them notices I've woken and asks, "What were you thinking?" And the others chime in with similar questions and grunts of accusation.

I was still too disoriented to answer. It had only happened twice now, but I was getting sick of these blackouts. With each once I felt I was slipping further away from myself. Sinking deeper from the surface of my body, which felt like an entity in someone else's control now.

"Stay here until your psychiatrist comes in. On the bed, where we can see you." The nurse clarified, glancing towards the corner of the room.

Another checked their tablet; and with a nod, they dispersed.

The moment they were gone the urgency returned, stronger now. Or maybe it had never really left. I honestly couldn't tell. My mind raced and warped my perception of time. Thoughts, fears, my sense of self, all compounded or collapsed rapidly onto themselves.

I looked up at the lens in the corner of the ceiling. I shifted in bed, trying to get it to move, but it sat, stoic, watching me, waiting to scream again. It had nothing to worry about this time though; I had found myself tied down again.

<span class="words-section-break"></span>

The door clicked with a metallic thud, and eased open. A stocky man, with a red mane and thick whiskers, stepped through the frame and propped the heavy door against the wall. He recited the name embroidered on his chest, and took a seat in the rolling chair.

"How are we doing today Mr. Reese?" He continued, as he swiped and tapped at the screen in his lap.

"I don't know. You tell me Doc." I said, stretching my neck forward to meet his face.

He smiled, silently, as if to appear amused, and untied my restraints.

"You're the one with answers, aren't you? Where is this? What happened to me?" I sputtered with my newfound urgency. "Am I okay?"

"Right, of course. Please excuse me. I'm Doctor Jenson, as I said, and you have nothing to worry about. You are safe now." He paused like he was waiting for me to believe it. "We are in a facility dedicated to the rehabilitation of people in your, situation."

"My situation?"

"You experienced a traumatic episode this morning." He looked down to confirm. "It says here, around 7am. Does that sound right?" He paused, then continued when I didn't immediately respond. "You may remember feeling overwhelmingly emotional. Often people have reported hearing a loud ringing. And on occasion, like in your case, experience black outs as a result."

I stared at him in confusion and disbelief. His words, my surrounds, all felt dream-like. I was aware of them, but they seemed constructed, and just out of reach.

"We think we can help you Julian. But first I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind."

His tone was kind, but firm. I could tell he wasn't asking. As if reciting a script he'd read countless times, he spoke without hesitation, with no doubt that it was being understood. Or like he was prepared for any unusual reactions.

"Sure," I said, hoping to learn more, if nothing else. It seemed easier than me trying to pry answers out of him.

He rattled off questions left and right, but none of them gave me much of a clue as to what exactly had happened. I tried asking more directly a few times, but somehow found myself answering another of his instead.

Questions like whether I had ever tried to remove the implant, or modify it in any way. I raised a hand to my skull—which was still tender—and shook my head.

He asked me about my life, my job, social groups, and how fulfilled I generally was—as if he was looking for a problem, as if he too didn't know why this had happened. I told him what I remembered of the last few days: the long hours at work, what I ate for dinner, the one night I had some trouble sleeping. I left out the part about the elderly woman in the subway. I couldn't tell yet if that was real or not. In response to my answers he kept asking, "how did you feel about that?" Or "is that because you were upset about something?" I didn't know, I told him. I guess I had found my mind wandering more than usual lately, which I finally admitted when asked directly if I'd noticed myself in a heightened emotional state. But maybe that always happens when I'm in the depths of research, and maybe I just always forget how it feels once I move on, when it seems like the article was always structured and inevitable. Like I knew the facts and how I was going to present them from the beginning.

He continued with questions about my medical history, my experience with mental health problems, any untreated allergies, and so on. I told him I didn't, that my parents had front loaded my gene therapy, and I'd had the implant since birth. He nodded expectantly without looking up from his notes. He paused, for a long while, and my patience wained.

"So, can I have the implant put back now? Or can you tell me what rehabilitation consists of? I'd like to get back to my life, Doc, and I'm not sure what use all these questions are."

He scoured over his notes for a while longer, with a pondering face.

"Here's what I can do for you Mr. Reese. It seems likely this wasn't caused by any mental or physical condition, which makes you a great candidate for our programs here. But before we go any further I need you to sign an NDA for us."

"You need an NDA to explain what's wrong with me?"

"It's corporate policy. Everything I tell you at this point is an educated guess at best, based on ongoing research, which makes it fall under the classification of intellectual property."

He held the tablet out towards me displaying a document and a place to sign.

"Thank you. We appreciate your cooperation."

He tapped the screen a few more times, in silence. Then he exhaled audibly and relaxed his shoulders.

"So. Julian. The truth is, we don't know why this is happening to people like you, but the good news is that's what we're here to figure out. We have Emotechs best neuroscientists, psychologist, biologists, chemists, and electrical and bio engineers all under this very roof working tirelessly to find the source of the problem, and the solution. But our current bottleneck is data. We just don't have a big enough sample size. This condition, 'the ring' as people are calling it, is still unbelievably rare. Only a thousand or so cases have been reported globally. But unfortunately only a few dozen have been in the USA. Everywhere else, treatment is being delegated entirely to medical facilities, which means two things. One, they can't use our diagnostic tools, and two, we don't have access to any of the data they are collecting."

"So this is some sort of implant malfunction?"

"At this point we really can't say anything for sure."

"But you took mine out anyway? Without my authorization."

"I apologize, but that's the only proven way we know of to prevent a reoccurrence."

I shook my head in disbelief. I felt as if I had been thrown into another world. A nightmare maybe. Was I asleep? I wondered to myself for a moment, then was embarrassed by the thought.

"So when can I go back to my life?"

"You're free to go at anytime, but I wouldn't recommend it."

He pulled up another document as he spoke. A contract this time; releasing them from liability for my condition, and committing me to cooperation in their "study," as the document called it. I took it and scrolled through the endless sea of crafted words.

"The few cases who have opted to be treated at hospitals," he continued, "have either relapsed, or been heavily reliant on medication, regular therapy sessions and emergency hospital visits. Temporary solutions, all of them. And shaky ones at that." He said with a subtle scoff. "This facility is your best chance at a real recovery Mr. Reese. At having a normal life again."

I skimmed through pages and pages until I finally made it to the blank line, patiently waiting for my name.

"We'll take good care of you here Mr. Reese. I guarantee it." He smiled. "I'm sure you don't want to rack up medical bills just to end up in the same place, or risk becoming a scavenger." He paused again. "If you join us here, Julian, you could help us make real progress towards a solution. Your case just might be the one that gives us the breakthrough we're looking for."
