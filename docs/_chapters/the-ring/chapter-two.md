I used to think I was more or less immune to doubt, but now I'm not so sure. Doubt is a side effect of a threatened mind, and all I saw were opportunities—I guess I largely had the implant to thank for that. But even still, on this day in early winter, a single question that I wasn't expecting started a chain reaction I at first had no awareness of, and then couldn't stop. I guess that's all it takes now.

The scent of earthy citrus permeating from the tree and filling the air. That's what I remember most. It's something I don't think I'll ever tire of—not even now. Tabitha was playing her clarinet in the other room. She insisted on it every night, not that we ever had objections. Tonight was something by Telemann I think. She must play incredibly well by now.

I was half way through the sink of dishes, wiping the streaks of curried butternut squash from the pot. I turned to Janet, admiring her. She glowed more radiant each time I looked. I caught her eye between passes of the mop across the tile floor. We smiled at one another.

"Would you start the kettle Dear?" She asked.

I finished rinsing a dish, wiped off my hands, and flipped the lever.

"Did you know," I said, returning to the dishes, "Emotech used to be a beverage company? Coffee, tea, beer, wine, all 'enriched' as they called them, with entheogens. Micro doses of course."

She gave me her usual inquisitive look, like she was considering every implication of this new information. The kettle grumbled.

"So the implant was made more for convenience then?" She said, and thought for a moment more. "How did they manage that? I assume there's not a lifetime supply packed into these things."

"Yeah! Exactly!" I said with a wild grin.

I always wondered why she didn't become a scientist. I wanted to, but turns out all I had was enthusiasm, and curiosity for things that had already been discovered. I could never make connections like she could. It seemed like it came so easily to her.

"So it turns out that most, or maybe all, of the various entheogens, at their core, were inhibiting or boosting the production of certain neuroreceptors. So all they had to do, which was no small task, was figure out how to stimulate the brain in the same way—to create that same environment. So much of what the human body does is in response to our environment. So if you can manufacture that—"

The mop handle hit the kitchen table, and Janet groaned. I whipped around, sending suds across the counter. She was folded over, grabbing her abdomen. I jumped over and grabbed her arm and placed a hand on her back.

"Are you okay?" I said as I helped her over to the armchair. "It seems like they're getting worse."

"I'm fine, really." With another groan she sat. "You're so sweet."

Once she was settled I brought her a glass of hot water, grated in some ginger and a dollop of honey.

"We can fix the shortcomings of the human mind, but still can't seem to make pregnancy any less painful." I sighed, or maybe I rolled my eyes.

She gazed into the forest that grew beyond our yard. "A little struggle in life is okay you know?"

I looked out the window, casting a parallel gaze.

"Yeah, that's what we have chores for." I chuckled. "Now you just rest, and I'll finish cleaning up."

"No, Julian. Honey." She set her hands on the armrests, and thrusted her giant belly out of the chair. "I can help. I'm not useless yet."

I rushed over to her, kissed her forehead and gently lowered her back into the chair. She could tell I was insisting, and I knew it would annoy her, but taking a break might help her, and she knew that, so she conceded. Like a well choreographed dance.

I stepped back into the kitchen and started with the mop—just in case she started to feel guilty and changed her mind. With the bending over and her belly increasingly getting in the way, doing the dishes just wasn't practical for her anymore.

"Julian," she said inquisitively, a few moments later. "What about those poor people in the facilities? What's happening to all of them? And why only now, after so many years?"

I told you she could make connections, like nobody I've ever met.

"I'm not sure yet. There's very little I've been able to find out about them. I'm hoping to learn more when I visit on Wednesday. But I wouldn't be too worried, they're in good hands now. And plus, it'll only be temporary. They're bound to figure out what's wrong with them sooner or later."

She looked at me with a skeptical smile.

"It's the scavengers we should really be worried about." I said, confidently interrupting her silence.

Looking back now, on all the times I thought I could clearly see, it makes me wonder whether I really know myself or the world at all.

"Oh yes. They were just talking about them on the news this morning. Are you going to interview one of them for your article?"

"There's plenty of literature out there already, and it seems like every day now there's another story about rising scavenger incidents. So I should have plenty of material."

She looked as if she was going to say more, or was lost in her thoughts somewhere. "Could you imagine? Having to live like that?"

"Yeah, well, it's a small price to pay for utopia."

Another wave surged through her chest and across her face. She propelled herself from the chair, eyes locked on the bathroom, approaching in a hurried wobble. I ran ahead of her and flung open the bathroom door. She groaned louder with every step. Her eyes were tense and mouth pressed shut. I noticed the music had stopped. The sound of prancing feet came down the hall.

"Is Mommy okay?" Tabitha asked, standing in the doorway.

Janet threw her head over the toilet bowl, and I kept a hand on her back.

"Yes, don't worry sweetie. Mommy is just tired from working so hard to make a sibling for you!"

Her face is innocent, her curiosity pure. She has her mothers lips, and her piercing, knowing eyes.

"Just a few more months and she'll be back to normal. I promise."

She calculates, and peeks over at her mother releasing into the bowl.

"Daddy. Is this always what happens with pregnancy?" Tabitha asked, a hint of concern in her expression.

"Every baby effects their mother to some degree. But mothers are strong. They're built that way."

Janet flushes to clear the bowl. I feel her body ease under my palm.

"Should I bring you to bed?" I ask her.

She shakes her head and wipes her mouth. I hear Tabitha walking off behind me.

"No, it'll pass. We should leave soon. We have to be at your parents for dessert."

"I'll reschedule for tomorrow. I'm sure they'll understand."

"Tomorrow we'll be at the Johnsons."

"Wednesday then."

"Have you gotten anything for Richard yet?"

There's a thud—Tabitha jumping from her bed again, I assume. I look back at the empty doorway. Tabitha reappears, with concern still lingering in her eyes. She watches Janet intently.

"Did I make her do that too?"

"Honey, this is completely normal. But we can talk about it more if you would like."

"Yes please." Tabitha smiles.
Janet heaves again.

"Let me finish helping Mommy, then I'll come answer any questions you have."

"Okay!" She says, and prances back down the hall.
